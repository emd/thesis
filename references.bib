Detailed 2D and quasi-3D images of the flux tubes obtained by an advanced imaging diagnostic system showed that the flux tubes are m / n = 1/1 field-aligned structures co-rotating around the magnetic axis. The flux tubes typically merge together and become like the internal kink mode of the usual sawtooth, which then collapses like a usual sawtooth crash. A systematic scan of ECH/CD beam position showed a strong correlation with the number of flux tubes. In the presence of multiple flux tubes close to the q = 1 surface, the radially outward heat transport was enhanced, which explains naturally temporal changes of electron temperature. We emphasize that the multiple flux tubes are a universal feature distinct from the internal kink instability and play a critical role in the control of sawteeth using ECH/CD.}

Usually, the external radiation is produced by objects at room temperature. D$\ast$$\ast$ is also appropriate for use with detectors that are non-Lambertian for reasons other than cooled radiation shields: for example, detectors that are immersed in a high-index medium, or detectors that are closely associated with a lens.},

  abstract = {A first-ever demonstration of controlling power and torque injection through time evolution of neutral beam energy has been achieved in recent experiments at the DIII-D tokamak (Luxon 2002 Nucl. Fusion 42 614). Pre-programmed waveforms for the neutral beam energy produce power and torque inputs that can be separately and continuously controlled. Previously, these inputs were tailored using on/off modulation of neutral beams resulting in large perturbations (e.g. power swings of over 1 MW). The new method includes, importantly for experiments, the ability to maintain a fixed injected power while varying the torque. In another case, different beam energy waveforms (in the same plasma conditions) produce significant changes in the observed spectrum of beam ion-driven instabilities. Measurements of beam ion loss show that one energy waveform results in the complete avoidance of coherent losses due to Alfvénic instabilities. This new method of neutral beam operation is intended for further application in a variety of DIII-D experiments including those concerned with high-performance steady state scenarios, fast particle effects, and transport in the low torque regime. Developing this capability would provide similar benefits and improved plasma control for other magnetic confinement fusion facilities.}

The correlation function and the power spectral density of the demodulated intensity noise are derived,taking into account the effect of bandpass filtering at the photodiode and an arbitrary demodulation waveform. The analysis includes demodulation of the RF-modulated shot noise as a special case of the intensity noise. For shot-noise-limited detection, the signal-to-noise ratio is found as a function of the modulation parameters, and the optimization of the signal-to-noise ratio with respect to the demodulation phase is described.}

  abstract = {Systematic procedures are presented for determining the optical components needed to produce an arbitrary transformation of a Gaussian light beams's spot size, radius of curvature, displacement, and direction of propagation. As an example, an optical system is considered that spatially separates the two coincident Gaussian beams produced by a high-diffraction-loss resonator that uses a Gaussian variable-reflectivity output coupler. In addition, an ABCDGH reverse matrix theorem and an ABCDGH Sylvester theorem are also derived. These matrix theorems may be used to satisfy special constraints inherent in the design of multipass and periodic optical systems.},

  abstract = {Measurements are presented of toroidicity-induced (TAEs) and reverse shear (RSAEs) Alfvén eigenmodes made using the standard two-colour CO 2 interferometer on DIII-D modified for increased bandwidth. Typical values of the effective line-integrated density perturbation in DIII-D are found to be d ( nL )/ nL ~ 10 −3 , and comparisons are made with NOVA calculations as well as magnetic measurements. There is a strong difference in the measured power spectrum between vertical and radial chords through the plasma. On average, vertical views are characterized by a larger line-integrated density perturbation due to TAEs than radial chords. Radial chords, however, can be used much more reliably than vertical chords to identify the presence of RSAEs in the plasma—a result found to be due to the radially localized nature of these modes. In general, the apparent amplitude of the observed modes for both TAE and RSAE is found to be highly dependent on viewing location.}
