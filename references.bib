  abstract={Multiple (two or more) flux tubes are commonly observed inside and/or near the q = 1 flux surface in KSTAR tokamak plasmas with localized electron cyclotron resonance heating and current drive (ECH/CD). Detailed 2D and quasi-3D images of the flux tubes obtained by an advanced imaging diagnostic system showed that the flux tubes are m / n = 1/1 field-aligned structures co-rotating around the magnetic axis. The flux tubes typically merge together and become like the internal kink mode of the usual sawtooth, which then collapses like a usual sawtooth crash. A systematic scan of ECH/CD beam position showed a strong correlation with the number of flux tubes. In the presence of multiple flux tubes close to the q = 1 surface, the radially outward heat transport was enhanced, which explains naturally temporal changes of electron temperature. We emphasize that the multiple flux tubes are a universal feature distinct from the internal kink instability and play a critical role in the control of sawteeth using ECH/CD.}

  abstract = {Systematic procedures are presented for determining the optical components needed to produce an arbitrary transformation of a Gaussian light beams's spot size, radius of curvature, displacement, and direction of propagation. As an example, an optical system is considered that spatially separates the two coincident Gaussian beams produced by a high-diffraction-loss resonator that uses a Gaussian variable-reflectivity output coupler. In addition, an ABCDGH reverse matrix theorem and an ABCDGH Sylvester theorem are also derived. These matrix theorems may be used to satisfy special constraints inherent in the design of multipass and periodic optical systems.},
