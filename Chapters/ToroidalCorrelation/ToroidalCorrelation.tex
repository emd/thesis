\chapter{Correlation of \diiid's toroidally separated interferometers}
\label{ch:ToroidalCorrelation}
\graffito{\textcolor{red}{rephrase}}
The toroidal structure of an MHD mode can strongly influence
the mode's stability and its interaction with the surrounding plasma.
A mode's toroidal structure is typically characterized
via the toroidal mode number $n$.
Historically, measurement of toroidal (and poloidal) mode numbers
with magnetic loops has provided rich insight
into the physics governing numerous operational regimes and stability limits.
However, core-localized MHD produces weak signals outside of the plasma volume,
making measurement of the corresponding mode numbers
via magnetic loops difficult or impossible.
Recently, measurements from toroidally separated
electron cyclotron emission imaging (ECEI) systems
on the KSTAR tokamak have identified mode numbers of
edge-localized modes~\cite{lee_rsi_2014} and
sawteeth~\cite{choe_nf_2015},
demonstrating the utility of using more exotic measurements
to probe the structure of core-localized MHD.

This chapter describes the use of toroidally separated interferometers
to measure toroidal mode numbers.
To the author's knowledge, this is the first such implementation in a tokamak.
The addition of the heterodyne interferometer channel
to \diiid's pre-existing phase contrast imaging (PCI) system
enabled this novel measurement.
Section~\ref{sec:ToroidalCorrelation:TwoPointCorrelation}
reviews the mathematics of the two-point correlation technique
used to extract toroidal mode numbers and
derives the resulting Nyquist mode number.
Section~\ref{sec:ToroidalCorrelation:interferometer_measurements}
examines the interferometric measurements in detail and
develops a formula for the measured toroidal mode number.
Section~\ref{sec:ToroidalCorrelation:implementation_details_and_nonideal_effects}
describes the careful efforts to remove time-base discrepancies
between the two interferometer systems and
also discusses the effect of the interferometers' radial offset.
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:ToroidalCorrelation:survey_of_spectra}
surveys representative mode-number spectra
from the toroidally correlated interferometers.


\section{Two-point correlation}
\label{sec:ToroidalCorrelation:TwoPointCorrelation}
Two-point correlation allows inference
of a propagating wave's spatial structure
from measurements made at two distinct spatial locations.
Below,
Section~\ref{sec:ToroidalCorrelation:TwoPointCorrelation:wavenumber_measurement}
details the two-point correlation technique.
Section~\ref{sec:ToroidalCorrelation:TwoPointCorrelation:aliasing}
then discusses the aliasing of large wavenumbers and
establishes the Nyquist wavenumber of a given measurement,
below which wavenumbers are \emph{not} aliased.
Finally,
Section~\ref{sec:ToroidalCorrelation:TwoPointCorrelation:toroidal_mode_numbers}
converts the results of the previous sections
into their toroidal-mode-number equivalents,
as is conventional for fluctuation characterization in a tokamak.


\subsection{Wavenumber measurement via two-point correlation}
\label{sec:ToroidalCorrelation:TwoPointCorrelation:wavenumber_measurement}
Consider a $1$-dimensional, coherent density fluctuation
with amplitude $\tilde{n}_0$, wavenumber $k$, and angular frequency $\omega$
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{n}(z, t)
  =
  \tilde{n}_0
  e^{i(k z - \omega t)}.
  \label{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:coherent_density_fluctuation}
\end{equation}
Imagine that the density is measured
at two locations separated by distance $\Delta z$,
producing two time series, $x(t)$ and $y(t)$, given as
\begin{align}
  x(t)
  &=
  \tilde{n}(z_0, t)
  \\
  y(t)
  &=
  \tilde{n}(z_0 + \Delta z, t)
  =
  x(t) e^{i k \Delta z}.
\end{align}
The cross phase $\alpha_{xy}$ between these two time series is
\begin{align}
  \alpha_{xy}
  &=
  \arg\left[ x^*(t) \cdot y(t) \right]
  \\
  &=
  k \Delta z,
\end{align}
where $x^*$ is the complex conjugate of $x$.
Thus, a measured wavenumber $k_{\meas}$
can be inferred from the cross phase via
\begin{equation}
  k_{\meas} = \frac{\alpha_{xy}}{\Delta z}.
  \label{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:wavenumber_from_cross_phase}
\end{equation}
The cross phase $\alpha_{xy}$ of $x(t)$ and $y(t)$
can be readily estimated via
the non-parametric, FFT-based
spectral-estimation techniques discussed in
Appendix~\ref{app:SpectralEstimation:NonParametric}.
Note that such cross-phase estimates are frequency-resolved,
allowing simultaneous characterization
of multiple fluctuations at distinct frequencies.


\subsection{Aliasing \& the Nyquist wavenumber}
\label{sec:ToroidalCorrelation:TwoPointCorrelation:aliasing}
The measured wavenumber
(\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:wavenumber_from_cross_phase})
may be \emph{aliased}.
To see this, note that the cross-phase estimate $\alpha_{xy}$
is only unique modulo $2 \pi$
(that is, $0$ is equivalent to $\pm 2 \pi$, $\pm 4 \pi$, etc.).
If the fluctuation wavenumber $k$ is sufficiently large
(i.e.\ if it exceeds the so-called Nyquist wavenumber $k_{\Ny}$),
this cross-phase ambiguity aliases the measured wavenumber
(\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:wavenumber_from_cross_phase})
away from the true wavenumber.

In the most general case,
the wave's propagation direction is not known \emph{a priori}, and
both positive and negative wavenumbers should be considered
(i.e.\ $-\pi < \alpha_{xy} \leq \pi$).
This cross-phase domain yields a Nyquist wavenumber
\begin{equation}
  k_{\Ny} = \frac{\pi}{\Delta z},
  \qquad \text{for \emph{unknown} propagation direction.}
  \label{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:Nyquist_wavenumber_unknown_propagation}
\end{equation}
Wavenumber measurements
(\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:wavenumber_from_cross_phase})
from fluctuations with $|k| > k_{\Ny}$ are aliased, while
measurements from fluctuations with $|k| \leq k_{\Ny}$ are not aliased.
Note that
(\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:Nyquist_wavenumber_unknown_propagation})
is equivalent to the famed Nyquist frequency:
making the transformations $\Delta z \rightarrow 1 / f_s$
for temporal sampling rate $f_s$ and
$k \rightarrow 2 \pi f$,
(\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:Nyquist_wavenumber_unknown_propagation})
readily becomes $f_{\Ny} = f_s / 2$.
Thus, $1 / \Delta z$ can be thought of as the spatial sampling rate,
with a larger sampling rate (i.e.\ smaller $\Delta z$)
allowing un-aliased measurements of larger wavenumbers.

Now, if the wave's propagation direction is known \emph{a priori}
(for example, if the wave propagation is dominated by advection, and
the fluid velocity is well-diagnosed),
only a single polarity of wavenumbers need to be considered.
For concreteness, positive wavenumbers are considered below
(i.e.\ $0 \leq \alpha_{xy} < 2 \pi$).
This cross-phase domain yields a Nyquist wavenumber
\begin{equation}
  k_{\Ny} = \frac{2 \pi}{\Delta z},
  \qquad \text{for \emph{known} propagation direction.}
  \label{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:Nyquist_wavenumber_known_propagation}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Measurement of toroidal mode numbers}
\label{sec:ToroidalCorrelation:TwoPointCorrelation:toroidal_mode_numbers}
Fluctuations in a torus are often characterized
by their toroidal $n$ and poloidal $m$ mode numbers,
both of which are constrained to be integers
by the toroidal and poloidal periodicities, respectively, of the torus.
For a torus with major radius $R$,
the toroidal mode number $n$ is related
to the toroidal wavenumber $k_{\zeta}$ as
\begin{equation}
  k_{\zeta} = \frac{n}{R},
\end{equation}
and the toroidal angular separation $\Delta \zeta$
is related to the spatial separation $\Delta z$ as
\begin{equation}
  \Delta \zeta = \frac{\Delta z}{R}.
\end{equation}
Using these definitions,
the above formulas for the measured wavenumber and the Nyquist wavenumber
can be rewritten in terms of toroidal mode numbers as follows:
\begin{align}
  n_{\text{meas}}
  &=
  \frac{\alpha_{xy}}{\Delta \zeta},
  \label{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:modenumber_from_cross_phase}
  \\
  n_{\text{Ny}}
  &=
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{\pi}{\Delta \zeta}
    \qquad \text{for \emph{unknown} propagation direction} \\
    \frac{2 \pi}{\Delta \zeta}
    \qquad \text{for \emph{known} propagation direction}
  \end{cases}.
  \label{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:Nyquist_modenumber}
\end{align}


\section{Toroidal correlation of interferometers}
\label{sec:ToroidalCorrelation:interferometer_measurements}
% This section applies the machinery developed in
% Section~\ref{sec:ToroidalCorrelation:TwoPointCorrelation}
% to the measurement of toroidal mode numbers
% with \diiid's toroidally separated, heterodyne CO$_2$ interferometers.
% As the interferometers are capable of probing the plasma core,
% their correlation allows direct measurement
% of the toroidal structure of core-localized modes
% --- a long-sought after and first-of-its-kind measurement at \diiid.
% This novel measurement was enabled by
% the addition of a heterodyne interferometer channel
% to \diiid's pre-existing phase contrast imaging (PCI) system.


\subsection{\diiid's interferometers}
\diiid's multichannel, two-color, heterodyne CO$_2$ interferometer
measures both the equilibrium~\cite{carlstrom_rsi88} and
fluctuating~\cite{vanzeeland_ppcf05, pace_nf17} components
of the line-integrated electron density.
Each channel is configured as a Michelson interferometer,
with each probe beam making a double-pass through the plasma.
The three vertical chords pass through the $V1$, $V2$, and $V3$ ports
at a toroidal location of $240^{\circ}$, while
the radial chord passes through the $R0$ port
at a toroidal location of $225^{\circ}$.
Of particular relevance to this work is the $V2$ interferometer,
which has a major-radial location $R = \SI{1.94}{\meter}$ and
is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ToroidalCorrelation:pci_interf_locs}.
The viewing geometry influences
an interferometer's sensitivity to various MHD instabilities;
for example, vertical chords are more sensitive to
toroidal Alfv\'{e}n eigenmodes (TAEs), while
radial chords are more sensitive to
reversed-shear Alfv\'{e}n eigenmodes (RSAEs)
\cite{vanzeeland_ppcf05}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{%

  \caption[Locations of the $V2$ and PCI interferometer beams on \diiid]{%
    (a) A top-down view of the \diiid\space vessel.
    The toroidal location of the $V2$ interferometer beam
    is $\zeta = 240^{\circ}$,
    and the toroidal location of the PCI beam
    is $\zeta = 285^{\circ}$.
    The \diiid\space sign convention for toroidal mode numbers
    is that $n > 0$ for modes that rotate counterclockwise
    when viewing the torus from above,
    as this corresponds to the direction of dominant torque injection.
    (b) A poloidal cross section of the \diiid\space vessel.
    The major-radial location of the $V2$ interferometer beam
    is $R = \SI{1.94}{\meter}$, and
    the major-radial location of the PCI beam
    is $R = \SI{1.98}{\meter}$.}
\label{fig:ToroidalCorrelation:pci_interf_locs}
\end{figure}

The addition of a heterodyne-interferometer channel
to \diiid's pre-existing phase contrast imaging (PCI) system
is discussed extensively in
Chapter~\ref{ch:Implementation} and
elsewhere~\cite{davis_rsi16}, but
the details of relevance to the toroidal-correlation measurement
are briefly reviewed here.
The PCI probe beam sits at a toroidal location of $285^{\circ}$ and
has a major-radial location $R = \SI{1.98}{\meter}$.
The location of the PCI beampath relative to that of the $V2$ interferometer
is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ToroidalCorrelation:pci_interf_locs}.

The geometry of the $V2$ and PCI interferometers
has consequences for the toroidal-correlation measurement.
The interferometers are
toroidally spaced by $\Delta \zeta = 45^{\circ}$
such that the Nyquist toroidal mode number
(\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:Nyquist_modenumber}) becomes
\begin{equation}
  n_{\text{Ny}}
  =
  \begin{cases}
    4
    \qquad \text{for \emph{unknown} propagation direction} \\
    8
    \qquad \text{for \emph{known} propagation direction}
  \end{cases}.
\end{equation}
The \diiid\space sign convention for toroidal mode numbers
is indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:ToroidalCorrelation:pci_interf_locs};
that is, $n > 0$ for modes that rotate counterclockwise
when viewing the torus from above,
as this corresponds to the direction of dominant torque injection.
Consistency with this sign convention requires
that $x(t)$ corresponds to the $V2$ interferometer signal and
that $y(t)$ corresponds to the PCI interferometer signal
when computing the toroidal mode number via
(\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:modenumber_from_cross_phase}).
Finally, the $V2$ and PCI interferometer beam paths have a slight radial offset
($\Delta R = \SI{4}{\centi\meter}$ with
$R_{V2} = \SI{1.94}{\meter}$ and $R_{\text{PCI}} = \SI{1.98}{\meter}$);
the consequences of this offset are discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:ToroidalCorrelation:implementation_details_and_nonideal_effects:radial_offset}.

For completeness, it should also be mentioned that
a three-chord, radially viewing Faraday-effect polarimeter-interferometer
was recently installed on \diiid's $285^{\circ}$ $R0$ port~\cite{chen_rsi16}.
While diagnosing core-localized magnetic fluctuations
is the primary impetus for this installation,
the system also measures line-integrated electron-density fluctuations.
Presumably, these measurements could be correlated with those from
the $225^{\circ}$ $R0$ CO$_2$ heterodyne interferometer.
However, these two systems do not have phase-locked sampling rates
(the necessity of which is discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:ToroidalCorrelation:implementation_details_and_nonideal_effects:phase_locked_sampling}),
so no attempts to correlate their interferometric measurements
are performed in this work.


\subsection{MHD plasma-density perturbations}
An MHD mode displaces a plasma from it's equilibrium position
by $\vect{\xi} = \vect{\xi}(\vect{r}, t)$.
The perturbed velocity is given as
$\vect{v}_1 = \partial \vect{\xi} / \partial t$
and, assuming harmonic variations, reduces to
\begin{equation}
  \vect{v}_1
  \equiv
  \frac{\partial \vect{\xi}}{\partial t}
  =
  -i \omega \vect{\xi},
  \notag
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is the mode's angular frequency.
The plasma density $n_i$ is given as
\begin{equation}
  n_i = \bar{n}_i + \tilde{n}_i,
  \notag
\end{equation}
where $\bar{n}_i$ and $\tilde{n}_i$ are
the equilibrium and fluctuating components, respectively.
Assuming a stationary equilibrium ($\vect{v}_0 = 0$) and
using the above relations,
the linearized continuity equation reduces to
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{n}_i = -\nabla \cdot (\bar{n}_i \vect{\xi}).
  \label{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:density_fluctuations}
\end{equation}
If we relax the assumption on $\vect{v}_0$ to allow
finite equilibrium flow ($\vect{v}_0 \neq 0$),
then the right-hand side of (\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:density_fluctuations})
is simply multiplied by the prefactor
$[1
- (\vect{v}_0 \cdot \vect{k} / \omega)
+ i (\nabla \cdot \vect{v}_0 / \omega)]^{-1}$, where
$\vect{k}$ is the mode wavevector.


\subsection{Interferometer-measured phase fluctuations}
The phase delay imparted to a CO$_2$ probe beam
propagating through a tokamak plasma
was discussed extensively in
Section~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:EM_waves_in_plasma}.
In particular, electron-density fluctuations $\tilde{n}_e$
produce phase fluctuations $\tilde{\phi}$ as given by
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:phase_fluctuation}),
which is repeated here for completeness:
\graffito{\textcolor{red}{Sign???}}
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\phi}
  =
  - r_e \lambda_0 \int \tilde{n}_e dl.
\end{equation}
Assuming quasineutrality $n_e \approx n_i$ and
invoking (\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:density_fluctuations}),
these phase fluctuations reduce to
\begin{align}
  \tilde{\phi}
  =
  r_e \lambda_0
  \int [\nabla \cdot (\bar{n}_e \vect{\xi})] dl.
  \label{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:phase_fluctuations_from_displacement}
\end{align}

Now, \diiid's $V2$ and PCI interferometers have \emph{vertical} beam paths
located at major radial ($R$) and toroidal ($\zeta$) coordinates
$(R_1, \zeta_1) = (\SI{1.94}{\meter}, \; 240^{\circ})$ and
$(R_2, \zeta_2) = (\SI{1.98}{\meter}, \; 285^{\circ})$, respectively.
Fourier decomposing the displacement $\vect{\xi}$ as
\begin{equation}
  \vect{\xi}(\vect{r}, t)
  =
  \vect{\xi}_0(r) e^{i(m \theta + n \zeta - \omega t)}
  \notag
\end{equation}
for poloidal ($m$) and toroidal ($n$) mode numbers and
real $\vect{\xi_0}(r)$,
(\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:phase_fluctuations_from_displacement}) becomes
\begin{align}
  \tilde{\phi}
  =
  r_e \lambda_0
  \int \left\{
    \nabla
    \cdot
    \left[
      \bar{n}_e \, \vect{\xi}_0(r) e^{i(m \theta + n \zeta - \omega t)}
    \right]
  \right\} dl.
  \notag
\end{align}
Finally, noting that $dl = dl(r, \theta)$ for vertical beam paths,
the phase fluctuations reduce to
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\phi}
  =
  \Phi e^{i(n \zeta - \omega t)},
  \label{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:phase_fluctuations_vertical_beam1}
\end{equation}
where
$\Phi
\equiv
\Phi(R, m, n, \vect{\xi}_0(r), \bar{n}_e(r), \vect{G})$
is a complex-valued function of
the beam's major radial location,
the mode structure,
the equilibrium density profile, and
the plasma geometry $\vect{G} = \vect{G}(R_0, a, \kappa, \delta, \cdots)$.
$\Phi$ can be written explicitly
as a complex value $\Phi = |\Phi| e^{i \sigma}$.

For a given mode and plasma,
the $V2$ and PCI interferometer beams see the \emph{same}
$\{m, n, \vect{\xi}_0(r), \bar{n}_e(r), \vect{G}\}$, and
$\Phi$ reduces to a one-dimensional function $\Phi = \Phi(R)$.
Thus, (\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:phase_fluctuations_vertical_beam1}) can
alternatively be written as
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\phi}
  =
  |\Phi(R)| e^{i[n \zeta - \omega t + \sigma(R)]},
  \label{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:phase_fluctuations_vertical_beam2}
\end{equation}
where the dependence on $R$ for a given mode and plasma
has been noted explicitly.
The phase angle $\alpha$ of $\tilde{\phi}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \alpha \equiv n \zeta - \omega t + \sigma(R)
  \label{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:phase_angle}
\end{equation}
such that $\tilde{\phi} = |\Phi| e^{i \alpha}$.


\subsection{The measured mode number --- the ideal case}
\graffito{\textcolor{red}{Do we have correct sign convention w/ $V2$}}
In the ideal case, phase fluctuations $\tilde{\phi}_1$ and $\tilde{\phi}_2$
are made at different toroidal locations $\zeta_1 \neq \zeta_2$ but
the \emph{same} radial locations $R_1 = R_2 = R$.
The one-sided cross-spectral density
$G_{12}(f) = |G_{12}(f)| e^{i \alpha_{12}(f)}$
then yields an estimate of the relative phase angle
$\alpha_{12} \equiv \alpha_2 - \alpha_1 = n(\zeta_2 - \zeta_1)$,
inspiring the definition of the measured toroidal mode number as
\begin{equation}
  n_{\text{meas}}
  \equiv
  \frac{\alpha_{12}}{\Delta \zeta},
  \quad \text{where} \quad
  \Delta \zeta \equiv \zeta_2 - \zeta_1.
  \label{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_ideal}
\end{equation}


\section{Implementation details and non-ideal effects}
\label{sec:ToroidalCorrelation:implementation_details_and_nonideal_effects}
Time-base discrepancies and offsets in major-radial position
between the $V2$ and PCI interferometers
can bias the measured mode number
(\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_ideal})
away from the true toroidal mode number $n$.
As discussed below, time-base discrepancies have been eliminated
by phase locking the interferometers' sampling rates
(a hardware solution) and
by post-processing the digitized data
to remove the constant time-base offset
that results from the discrepancy
between each system's nominal and realized trigger times
(a software solution).
The major-radial offset of the interferometer probe beams
can result in tell-tale, artificial mode-number ``flips''.
Barring increased radial overlap (i.e.\ $\Delta R \rightarrow 0$),
interpretation of toroidal mode number measurements
from modes with substantial radial structure
\graffito{\textcolor{red}{forward-modeling ref}}
may require forward modeling.


\subsection{Phase-locked sampling}
\label{sec:ToroidalCorrelation:implementation_details_and_nonideal_effects:phase_locked_sampling}
Extracting useful information
from the correlation of two measurements
requires that the sampling rates of the two measurements
are \emph{phase-locked}.
If the sampling rates are \emph{not} phase-locked,
slippage between the sampling rates
will result in artificial evolution of the measured phase.

Digitizing the two signals on a common digitizer
is the simplest method for ensuring phase-locked sampling.
Unfortunately, such an approach is not suitable
for the $V2$ and PCI interferometer signals.
The $V2$ interferometer's
$f_{\text{IF}} = \SI{40}{\mega\hertz}$ intermediate-frequency signal
is demodulated using an all-digital technique
that mandates a use of a sampling rate
$f_s = (4 / 3) f_{\text{IF}}$
\cite{vanzeeland_rsi08}, and
the baseband $I$ and $Q$ signals never exist in analog form.
In contrast, as described in
Chapter~\ref{ch:Implementation} and \cite{davis_rsi16},
the PCI interferometer's
$f_{\text{IF}} = \SI{27}{\mega\hertz}$ intermediate-frequency signal
is demodulated with analog electronics, and
the analog baseband $I$ and $Q$ signals
are then digitized on two channels of a D-tAcq ACQ216 CPCI board.
Because the $V2$ interferometer's baseband $I$ and $Q$ signals
never exist in analog form,
it is not possible to digitize the $V2$ $I$ and $Q$ signals
on the digitizer used by the PCI interferometer.
Further, because of the intermediate-frequency mismatch
between the $V2$ and PCI interferometers,
it is also not possible digitally demodulate and digitize
the PCI interferometer's $\SI{27}{\mega\hertz}$ intermediate-frequency signal
using the $V2$ interferometer's
$\SI{40}{\mega\hertz}$ digital demodulation system.
An alternative approach is to directly digitize
both intermediate-frequency signals
with a high-bandwidth digitizer and
demodulate both signals in software,
as has been done elsewhere~\cite{mlynek_fst12}.
While \diiid's ion cyclotron emission (ICE) digitizer
has a $200 \, \text{MS/s}$ sample rate,
channels on the ICE digitizer are not consistently available.

As sharing a common digitizer is not possible,
phase-locked sampling between the $V2$ and PCI interferometers
requires that the digitizers of both systems
derive their clock from a common source.
The $V2$ interferometer derives its clock
from a free-running, oven-controlled oscillator
whose base frequency is $\SI{320}{\mega\hertz}$, and
the digital demodulation system
has two spare outputs that can be programmed
to output LVCMOS-level, phase-locked clock signals
at $\SI{320}{\mega\hertz} / N$, where
$N \in \{1, 2, 3, ..., 32\}$.
Both outputs are currently programmed with a divisor $N = 20$
such that they each provide a $\SI{16}{\mega\hertz}$ clock signal.
\graffito{\textcolor{red}{Picture? For posterity}}
One of these $\SI{16}{\mega\hertz}$ clock signals
is routed via coaxial cable
from the $V2$ digital demodulation hardware
in the first row of the \diiid\space ``annex''
to the PCI's digitizer
in the third row of the \diiid\space ``annex''.

The PCI digitizer typically samples at $f_s = 4 \, \text{MS/s}$.
Thus, division of the $V2$ $\SI{16}{\mega\hertz}$ clock by four
(in hardware or software) yields a clock appropriate for typical sampling.
Each board can accept an external clock
through the front panel's single-pin LEMO CLK input.
The CLK signal passes through an optocoupler
with a bandwidth $\sim \SI{10}{\mega\hertz}$
\cite{milne_optocoupler_pc16}, but
in-house tests have demonstrated
that the input clock frequency
can actually exceed $\SI{16}{\mega\hertz}$.
As a result, the $\SI{16}{\mega\hertz}$ signal
is directly connected to the front panel CLK lemo input, and
the necessary division
(e.g.\ divide by four to achieve typical $4 \, \text{MS/s}$ sampling rate)
is performed within the digitizer;
it is the author's opinion that
this is cleaner, simpler, and more easily extensible
(i.e.\ easier to implement other sampling rates)
than performing the division in hardware.
Details of the signal routing and the clock division
are provided in \ldots % Appendix~\ref{app:ExternalClock}.
Thus, as of June 2016,
the $V2$ and PCI interferometer sampling rates
are phase-locked.


\subsection{Eliminating the time-base offset}
The $V2$ and PCI interferometer sampling rates are phase-locked,
as both systems share a common clock.
However, phase-locked sampling rates do \emph{not} guarantee
identical/ideal \emph{triggering} of both systems, so
there could very well be an offset between the
$V2$ and PCI interferometer time bases.

Imagine that the time bases between $\tilde{\phi}_1$ and $\tilde{\phi}_2$
are offset by constant $\delta t$ such that
$t_1 \equiv t$ and $t_2 \equiv t + \delta t$.
Then, for \emph{constant} angular frequency ($\omega = \text{const}$),
$\alpha_{12} = n \Delta \zeta - \omega \delta t$
such that application of
(\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_ideal})
yields a measured mode number
\begin{equation}
  n_{\text{meas}} = n - \frac{\omega \delta t}{\Delta \zeta}.
  \label{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_dt_constant_omega}
\end{equation}
That is, the measured mode number will be biased away from
the true mode number by a constant DC offset.
If the true mode number $n$ is known,
then (\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_dt_constant_omega})
can be used to determine the time-base offset $\delta t$.

Now, in addition to constant time offset $\delta t$,
imagine that the mode's angular frequency is ramping linearly in time
($\dot{\omega} = \partial \omega / \partial t = \text{const}$) such that
$\omega(t + \delta t) = \omega(t) + \dot{\omega} \delta t$.
Then,
$\alpha_{12}
=
n \Delta \zeta - [\omega(t)] \delta t - (\dot{\omega} \delta t) t$
such that application of
(\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_ideal})
yields a measured mode number that also ramps linearly in time
\begin{equation}
  \dot{n}_{\text{meas}}
  =
  - \left( \frac{2 \dot{\omega}}{\Delta \zeta} \right) \delta t.
  \label{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_dt_ramp_rate}
\end{equation}
Note that (\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_dt_ramp_rate}) is
\emph{independent} of the true toroidal mode number $n$,
unlike (\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_dt_constant_omega}).
Further, if $\delta t$ is ``large''
(i.e.\ $|\omega \delta t / \Delta \zeta| > n_{\text{Ny}}$),
$n_{\text{meas}}$ may be aliased and application of
(\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_dt_constant_omega})
will give an incorrect value for $\delta t$.
Thus, if the frequency of the mode is ramping \emph{and}
the measured toroidal mode number $n_{\text{meas}}$ is also ramping in time,
(\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_dt_ramp_rate})
can be used to determine the time-base offset $\delta t$ and
is superior to application of
(\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_dt_constant_omega}).

\graffito{\textcolor{red}{Improve explanation}}
To make use of (\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_dt_ramp_rate}),
$\dot{\omega}$ must be computed from experimental measurements.
Note that the \emph{measured} angular frequency is given as
$\omega_{\text{meas}} \equiv \partial[\omega(t) \cdot t] / \partial t$.
In the case where $\omega = \text{const}$,
this yields the expected result that $\omega_{\text{meas}} = \omega$.
However, if the angular frequency is ramping linearly in time
($\omega(t) = \omega_0 + \dot{\omega} t$), then
$\omega_{\text{meas}} = \omega_0 + 2 \dot{\omega} t$ and
$\dot{\omega}_{\text{meas}} = 2 \dot{\omega}$.
Thus, (\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_dt_ramp_rate}) becomes
\begin{equation}
  \dot{n}_{\text{meas}}
  =
  - \left( \frac{\dot{\omega}_{\text{meas}}}{\Delta \zeta} \right) \delta t.
  \label{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_dt_ramp_rate_lab_frame}
\end{equation}

    are \emph{incorrectly} computed.}

\end{figure}

\graffito{\textcolor{red}{Improve discussion of two estimates}}
Now, Fig.~\ref{fig:ToroidalCorrelation:uncompensated_time_delay} shows an example
of the computed toroidal mode number spectrum
when using the native time-bases of the $V2$ and PCI interferometers;
the corresponding magnetics spectrum is shown for comparison.
For $t \lesssim \SI{1.5}{\second}$
the mode frequencies are ramping approximately linearly in time, and
the interferometer-measured mode number is (artificially) ramping in time,
in contrast to the corresponding measurements from magnetics;
application of
(\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_dt_ramp_rate_lab_frame})
to the \emph{highest-frequency} mode observed by the interferometers yields
$\delta t \approx \SI{-30}{\micro\second}$
($\Delta n = 5$, $\Delta f \approx \SI{20}{\kilo\hertz}$,
as indicated by the positions of the small circular annotations
to the highest frequency mode in
Fig.~\ref{fig:ToroidalCorrelation:uncompensated_time_delay}).
Further, note that the mode number evolution \emph{reverses}
after the mode reaches its peak frequency,
in agreement with the behavior expected from
(\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_dt_ramp_rate_lab_frame}).
Finally, for $t \gtrsim \SI{2}{\second}$
the mode frequencies are constant, but
the interferometer-measured mode numbers are in disagreement with magnetics.
Naive application of
(\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_dt_constant_omega})
to the \emph{lowest-frequency} mode at $f \approx \SI{20}{\kilo\hertz}$
yields $\delta t \approx \SI{20}{\micro\second}$
($n_{\text{meas}} = -2$, $n = 1$,
$\omega \approx 2 \pi \cdot \SI{20}{\kilo\hertz}$),
in contrast with the above time-delay estimate
from the linearly ramping mode numbers.
However, as warned above,
$n_{\text{meas}}$ will be \emph{aliased} for ``large'' time delays:
using the above parameters for the lowest-frequency mode,
we see that $|\omega \delta t / \Delta \zeta| \approx 4.8 > n_{\text{Ny}}$,
where $n_{\text{Ny}} = 4$ is the Nyquist mode number
for the $\Delta \zeta = 45^{\circ}$ toroidal separation of the interferometers,
confirming that aliasing has biased the time-delay estimate.
To account for aliasing, take $n_{\text{meas}} = -2 \rightarrow 6$, and
application of
(\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_dt_constant_omega}) yields
$\delta t \approx -\SI{30}{\micro\second}$,
in agreement with the time-delay estimate
from the linearly ramping mode numbers!

The above observations are all consistent with there being an offset
between the native time-bases of the PCI and $V2$ interferometers, and
the two \emph{independent} measurements of this time offset are in agreement,
with each yielding an offset $\delta t \approx \SI{-30}{\micro\second}$.
Indeed, delaying the PCI signal by $-\SI{30}{\micro\second}$
relative to the $V2$ signal in software dramatically improves
the agreement between the interferometer and magnetics mode number spectra.
By scanning $\delta t$ about $-\SI{30}{\micro\second}$ and
noting when discrepancy with magnetics began to creep back into
the interferometer-measured mode spectrum,
the upper and lower bounds of $\delta t$ were found;
the best estimate for $\delta t$ was then taken as the midpoint
between these upper and lower bounds, which was found to be
\begin{equation}
  \delta t = -\SI{32}{\micro\second}.
  \label{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:time_delay}
\end{equation}
That is, the native PCI-interferometer's time base \emph{leads}
the native $V2$ time base by $\SI{32}{\micro\second}$.
Delaying the PCI-interferometer by $\SI{32}{\micro\second}$ (in software)
relative to the $V2$ interferometer yields the mode number spectrum
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ToroidalCorrelation:compensated_time_delay}.
Note that both
Fig.~\ref{fig:ToroidalCorrelation:uncompensated_time_delay} and
Fig.~\ref{fig:ToroidalCorrelation:compensated_time_delay}
correspond to shot 167341, and
the only difference in the interferometer-measured mode-number spectrum
between the two figures results from the compensation of the time delay
between the native time bases of the two interferometers.

\textcolor{red}{Note that additional measurements are needed
to determine which clock is correct in the \emph{absolute} sense.
For example, we can try digitizing a trigger signal and
comparing the digitized time of the trigger to the ``nominal'' trigger time
to determine the offset of our digitizer from the DIII-D clock.}

    Here, the PCI-interferometer signal has been delayed by

    to account for the time offset between each system's native time base.
    Note that the agreement with magnetics is excellent and that
    the mode numbers of the ramping-frequency modes are no longer
    artificially ramping;
    this is an enormous improvement over the corresponding
    uncompensated interferometer-measured spectrum in
    Fig.~\ref{fig:ToroidalCorrelation:uncompensated_time_delay}.}

\subsection{Effects of radial offset}
\label{sec:ToroidalCorrelation:implementation_details_and_nonideal_effects:radial_offset}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{red}{ECE to confirm radial mode structure}
  \item \textcolor{red}{Correlate $V1$, $V2$, $V3$ to see just radial effect}
\end{itemize}
The $V2$ and PCI interferometer beam paths have a slight radial offset
($\Delta R = \SI{4}{\centi\meter}$ with
$R_{\text{V2}} = \SI{1.94}{\meter}$ and $R_{\text{PCI}} = \SI{1.98}{\meter}$).
Thus, $\alpha_{12} = n(\zeta_2 - \zeta_1) + [\sigma(R_2) - \sigma(R_1)]$,
where
\begin{equation}
  \sigma(R_2) - \sigma(R_1)
  \approx
  \begin{cases}
    0, & \quad \text{$\vect{\xi}(R_1)$ and $\vect{\xi}(R_2)$ in-phase} \\
    \pi, & \quad \text{$\vect{\xi}(R_1)$ and $\vect{\xi}(R_2)$ out-of-phase}
  \end{cases},
  \notag
\end{equation}
gives the relative phase of $\vect{\xi}$
at $R_2$ relative to that at $R_1$.
If $\vect{\xi}(R_1)$ and $\vect{\xi}(R_2)$ are in-phase,
then application of (\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_ideal})
will yield the correct mode number.
However, if $\vect{\xi}(R_1)$ and $\vect{\xi}(R_2)$ are out-of-phase,
then application of (\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_ideal})
will yield a measured mode number $n_{\text{meas}}$
\graffito{\textcolor{red}{Correct sign for alias??}}
\begin{equation}
  n_{\text{meas}}
  =
  \begin{cases}
    n + n_{\text{Ny}}, & \quad n \leq 0 \\
    n - n_{\text{Ny}}, & \quad n > 0
  \end{cases},
  \label{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_radially_out_of_phase}
\end{equation}
where $n_{\text{Ny}} \equiv \pi / \Delta \zeta$
is the Nyquist toroidal mode number, and
the $n > 0$ case results from \emph{aliasing}
(that is, $n + n_{\text{Ny}} \rightarrow n - n_{\text{Ny}}$
when $n > 0$ because of aliasing).
Lacking additional measurements or some type of forward modeling,
this incorrect mode-number identification may go undiagnosed.
However, if $\vect{\xi}(R)$ evolves such that
$\vect{\xi}(R_1)$ and $\vect{\xi}(R_2)$ transition
from being in-phase to being out-of-phase (or vice versa),
the measured mode number will ``flip'';
an example of this mode-number ``flipping''
is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ToroidalCorrelation:mode_number_flips}.
Further effects of the radial offset can be investigated
via forward modeling.

  \caption[Mode-number ``flipping'' due to the small radial offset

    Due to the small radial offset ($\Delta R = \SI{4}{\centi\meter}$)
    between the $V2$ and PCI interferometers,
    changes in the radial structure of a mode
    can result in ``flipping'' of the interferometer-measured mode number.
    Here, the mode number flips from $n = 2$ to $n = -2$,
    consistent with
    (\ref{eq:ToroidalCorrelation:toroidal_mode_number_radially_out_of_phase}).
    Lacking additional measurements or some type of forward modeling,
    it is impossible to determine if the mode is truly $n = 2$ or $n = -2$.
    Note that these modes exceed the typical bandwidth of magnetics, however,
    so even identification as $n = \pm 2$ \emph{is} an improvement!}
