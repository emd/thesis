\chapter{Interferometric methods for tokamak-plasma fluctuations}
\label{ch:InterferometricMethods}
Interferometric methods exploit the interaction of
electromagnetic waves with a plasma
to ascertain properties of the plasma's density.
Because surveying every flavor of interferometric method
exceeds the scope of this work,
only the interferometric methods
of direct relevance to this work ---
external reference-beam interferometry and phase contrast imaging (PCI) ---
are discussed in detail.
Further, the emphasis is diagnosis of the plasma's density fluctuations
rather than its equilibrium density.
The overview of optical interferometry in
Section~\ref{sec:Introduction:OpticalInterferometry}
is mandatory background for this chapter.
While Section~\ref{sec:Introduction:OpticalInterferometry}
cavalierly assumes various forms for the interfering radiation fields,
this chapter provides first-principles descriptions
of the laser-plasma interaction and optical systems needed
to produce these radiation fields.

Below, Section~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:EM_waves_in_plasma}
examines the propagation of electromagnetic waves through a ``cold'' plasma
and derives an expression for the plasma-induced phase delay.
Section~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:Gaussian_beam_diffraction} reveals that
plasma-density fluctuations weakly upscatter and downscatter
an incident Gaussian probe beam, while
Section~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:imaging} describes
how an imaging system manipulates these scattered beams.
Section~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:interferometry} shows that
interfering the imaged probe radiation with an external reference beam
is an effective technique for diagnosing plasma-density fluctuations and
discusses the relative merits of homodyne versus heterodyne detection.
Section~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:pci} details the principles of
phase contrast imaging (PCI),
which does away with an external reference beam and
instead spatially filters the scattered and unscattered beams
to produce an informative interference signal.
Section~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:selection}
concludes the chapter by synthesizing the preceding results and
discussing the strengths and limitations of each interferometric technique.


\section{Electromagnetic waves in a plasma}
\label{sec:InterferometricMethods:EM_waves_in_plasma}
A great deal can be learned about a plasma
by probing it with electromagnetic waves.
Sections~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:EM_waves_in_plasma:derivation_of_wave_equation}---
\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:EM_waves_in_plasma:cold_plasma_dispersion_relation}
derive the index of refraction $N$ for a cold, homogeneous plasma.
Section~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:EM_waves_in_plasma:propagation_in_inhomogeneous_medium}
extends these results to inhomogeneous plasmas via the WKB approximation and
assesses the validity of this approach for
a CO$_2$ probe beam in a typical tokamak plasma, and
Section~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:EM_waves_in_plasma:plasma_induced_phase_delay}
computes the resulting plasma-induced phase delay.


\subsection{Derivation of the wave equation}
\label{sec:InterferometricMethods:EM_waves_in_plasma:derivation_of_wave_equation}
The electric field $\vect{E}$ and the magnetic field $\vect{B}$
of an electromagnetic wave are coupled via Faraday's law
\begin{equation}
  \nabla \cross \vect{E}
  =
  - \frac{\partial \vect{B}}{\partial t}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Faradays_law}
\end{equation}
and Ampere's law
\begin{equation}
  \nabla \cross \vect{B}
  =
  \mu_0 \vect{J}
  +
  \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \vect{E}}{\partial t},
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Amperes_law}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space,
$\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, and
$\vect{J}$ is the current density~\cite[Sec.~I.1]{jackson_E&M}.
Note that (\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:Faradays_law}) and
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:Amperes_law}) are the vacuum formulations
of Faraday's law and Ampere's law;
however, they can still be used to describe
an electromagnetic wave's propagation through a medium
\emph{if} that medium's electromagnetic properties
are explicitly accounted for in the current density $\vect{J}$
\cite[Sec.~I.4]{jackson_E&M}\cite[Sec.~4.1]{hutchinson_diagnostics}.
Now, taking the curl of Faraday's law and
then using Ampere's law to eliminate $\vect{B}$
yields the electric field's wave equation
\begin{equation}
  \nabla^2 \vect{E}
  -
  \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \vect{E}}{\partial t^2}
  =
  \nabla(\nabla \cdot \vect{E})
  +
  \mu_0 \frac{\partial \vect{J}}{\partial t}.
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:wave_equation_pde}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Wave equation in a homogeneous medium}
Fourier decomposing the electric field and the current density
\begin{align}
  \vect{E}(\vect{r}, t)
  &=
  \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^4}
  \int
  \vect{E}(\vect{k}', \omega')
  e^{i(\vect{k}' \cdot \vect{r} - \omega' t)}
  d\vect{k'} \, d\omega',
  \\
  \vect{J}(\vect{r}, t)
  &=
  \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^4}
  \int
  \vect{J}(\vect{k}', \omega')
  e^{i(\vect{k}' \cdot \vect{r} - \omega' t)}
  d\vect{k'} \, d\omega'.
\end{align}
reduces the wave equation (\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:wave_equation_pde})
to an algebraic equation for each Fourier component.
In particular, for the Fourier mode described by
$\vect{E}_0 e^{i(\vect{k} \cdot \vect{r} - \omega t)}$ and
$\vect{J}_0 e^{i(\vect{k} \cdot \vect{r} - \omega t)}$,
the derivative operators become
$\nabla \rightarrow i \vect{k}$ and
$\partial / \partial t \rightarrow -i \omega$, and
the wave equation reduces to
\begin{equation}
  \left(%
    \vect{N}\vect{N}
    -
    N^2\vect{I}
    +
    \vect{I}
  \right)
  \cdot
  \vect{E}_0
  =
  -\frac{i \vect{J_0}}{\varepsilon_0 \omega},
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:wave_equation_algebraic}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \vect{N} \equiv \frac{c \vect{k}}{\omega}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:refraction_index}
\end{equation}
is the index of refraction seen by the given Fourier mode and
$\vect{I}$ is the identity matrix.
Now, assume that the medium is
homogeneous in space and time~\cite[Sec.~3-2]{stix}
such that the current density
is easily related to the electric field via Ohm's law
\begin{equation}
  \vect{J}(\vect{k}, \omega)
  =
  \vect{\sigma}(\vect{k}, \omega)
  \cdot
  \vect{E}(\vect{k}, \omega),
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Ohms_law}
\end{equation}
where $\vect{\sigma}$ is the conductivity of the surrounding medium
\cite[Sec.~I.4]{jackson_E&M}.
Substituting the Ohm's law current density
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:Ohms_law}) into
the Fourier-decomposed wave equation
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:wave_equation_algebraic})
yields the eigenvalue equation
\begin{equation}
  \left[%
    \vect{N}\vect{N}
    -
    N^2\vect{I}
    +
    \left(%
      \vect{I}
      +
      \frac{i \vect{\sigma}}{\varepsilon_0 \omega}
    \right)
  \right]
  \cdot
  \vect{E}_0
  =
  0.
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:wave_equation_eigenvalue}
\end{equation}
To proceed further, a model is needed
for the medium's conductivity.


\subsection{The cold-plasma index of refraction}
\label{sec:InterferometricMethods:EM_waves_in_plasma:cold_plasma_dispersion_relation}
Although plasmas in contemporary fusion devices
routinely approach temperatures $\lesssim 100$ million degrees Celsius
($\sim10\times$ the temperature of the core of the sun!),
the thermal velocities of the constituent particles are
still far below the speed of light.
The lightest, and consequently the fastest,
of such a plasma's constituent particles are its electrons,
which have thermal velocities $\lesssim 0.1 c$.
In contrast, as will be shown shortly,
the electromagnetic waves used to make interferometric measurements
in such plasmas have phase velocities very close to the speed of light.
Thus, in the context of the wave-plasma interaction,
the unperturbed plasma can be modeled as a collection
of motionless (i.e.\ zero-temperature or ``cold'') charged particles.
Consequently, the pressure of this model plasma is zero.
For the present application, it is also appropriate
to neglect the perturbed motion of the ions,
whose inertia greatly exceeds that of the electrons, and
to neglect collisions,
which are relatively rare in fusion plasmas.
The electron-fluid momentum equation for such a plasma is
\begin{equation}
  m_e n_e \frac{d \vect{v}_e}{dt}
  =
  -e n_e \left( \vect{E} + \vect{v}_e \cross \vect{B} \right),
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:cold_plasma_momentum_equation}
\end{equation}
where $n_e$ is the electron density,
$\vect{v}_e$ is the perturbed electron-fluid velocity, and
$d/dt = \partial / \partial t + (\vect{v}_e \cdot \nabla)$
is the advective time derivative.
Linearizing and Fourier analyzing
the electron-fluid momentum equation
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:cold_plasma_momentum_equation})
yields
\begin{equation}
  i \omega m_e \vect{v}_e
  =
  e \left( \vect{E} + \vect{v}_e \cross \vect{B}_0 \right),
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:cold_plasma_momentum_equation_linear_and_Fourier}
\end{equation}
where $\vect{B}_0$ is the equilibrium magnetic field.
Let $\vect{B}_0 = B_0 \hat{\vect{z}}$.
Then, the perturbed electron-fluid velocity $\vect{v}_e$
is easily found to be~\cite[Sec.~4.1.2]{hutchinson_diagnostics}
\begin{align}
  \text{v}_{e,x}
  &=
  \frac{-i e}{\omega m_e}
  \frac{1}{1 - \Omega_e^2 / \omega^2}
  \left( E_x - i \frac{\Omega_e}{\omega} E_y \right),
  \\
  \text{v}_{e,y}
  &=
  \frac{- i e}{\omega m_e}
  \frac{1}{1 - \Omega_e^2 / \omega^2}
  \left( i \frac{\Omega_e}{\omega} E_x + E_y \right),
  \\
  \text{v}_{e,z}
  &=
  \frac{- i e}{\omega m_e} E_z,
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
  \Omega_e \equiv \frac{e B_0}{m_e}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:cyclotron_frequency_electron}
\end{equation}
is the electron cyclotron frequency.
Having neglected the ion's motion,
the current density is simply
\begin{equation}
  \vect{J} = -e n_e \vect{v}_e.
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:current_density_electron_motion}
\end{equation}
Equating the current densities from
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:Ohms_law}) and
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:current_density_electron_motion})
and substituting the solution for $\vect{v}_e$ yields
the plasma's conductivity~\cite[Sec.~4.1.2]{hutchinson_diagnostics}
\begin{equation}
  \vect{\sigma}
  =
  \frac{i n_e e^2}{m_e \omega}
  \frac{1}{1 - \Omega_e^2 / \omega^2}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1                   & -i \Omega_e / \omega & 0
    \\
    i \Omega_e / \omega &  1                   & 0
    \\
    0                   & 0                    & 1 - \Omega_e^2 / \omega^2
  \end{pmatrix}.
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:cold_plasma_conductivity}
\end{equation}
Choose axes such that
\begin{equation}
  \vect{k} = k ( \sin\theta \hat{\vect{y}} + \cos\theta \hat{\vect{z}} ).
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:wavevector_in_convenient_basis}
\end{equation}
Then, substituting the cold-plasma conductivity
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:cold_plasma_conductivity})
into the electric field's eigenvalue equation
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:wave_equation_eigenvalue})
and solving for the corresponding eigenvalues yields
the well-known Appleton-Hartree formula
for the plasma's index of refraction
\cite[Sec.~4.1.2]{hutchinson_diagnostics}
\begin{equation}
  N^2
  =
  1
  -
  \frac{X (1 - X)}{ 1 - X - \frac{1}{2} Y^2 \sin^2 \theta \pm \Delta },
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Appleton_Hartree}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
  X &\equiv \frac{\omega_{pe}^2}{\omega^2},
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:X}
  \\
  Y &\equiv \frac{\Omega_e}{\omega},
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Y}
  \\
  \Delta
  &=
  \left[
    \left( \frac{1}{2} Y^2 \sin^2\theta \right)^2
    +
    (1 - X)^2 Y^2 \cos^2\theta
  \right]^{1/2},
  \\
  \omega_{pe}^2 &\equiv \frac{n_e e^2}{m_e \varepsilon_0};
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:angular_electron_plasma_frequency}
\end{align}
here, $\omega_{pe}$ is referred to as the angular electron plasma frequency.

The refractive index formula
can be dramatically simplified
for high-frequency electromagnetic waves
propagating in typical tokamak plasmas.
For example, a CO$_2$ beam ($\omega = 2 \pi \cdot \SI{28.3}{\tera\hertz}$)
propagating in a typical \diiid\space plasma sees
\begin{align}
  n_e
  \lesssim
  \SI{e20}{\per\meter\cubed}
  \qquad
  &\Rightarrow
  \qquad
  X \lesssim 10^{-5},
  \notag \\
  B
  \lesssim
  \SI{2}{\tesla}
  \qquad
  &\Rightarrow
  \qquad
  Y \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-3}.
  \notag
\end{align}
Now, the smallness of $X$ and $Y$ can be exploited
to approximate the Appleton-Hartree index of refraction
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:Appleton_Hartree})
by retaining only the terms that are linear in $X$ or linear in $Y$;
this yields $N^2 \approx 1 - X$ or, equivalently,
\begin{equation}
  N \approx 1 - \frac{X}{2}.
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:index_of_refraction}
\end{equation}
Note that the corresponding phase velocity is
$v_{\text{ph}} = c / N \approx c$.
Thus, the cold-plasma assumption that the wave's phase velocity
is much larger than the thermal velocities ($\lesssim 0.1 c$)
of the plasma's constituent particles is valid.

It is enlightening to also examine
the corresponding electric-field eigenvectors.
Substituting the index of refraction
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:index_of_refraction})
into the corresponding eigenvalue equation
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:wave_equation_eigenvalue}) and
solving to lowest order for the corresponding eigenvector yields
\begin{equation}
  \vect{E}_0
  \approx
  E_{0,x} \hat{\vect{x}}
  +
  E_{0,yz} (\hat{\vect{k}} \cross \hat{\vect{x}}),
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:electric_field_eigenvector}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\vect{k}} = \vect{k} / |\vect{k}|$
is the unit vector corresponing to the wavector defined in
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:wavevector_in_convenient_basis}), and
$E_{0,x}$ and $E_{0,yz}$ are arbitrary, uncoupled constants
that are independent of the plasma's properties.
Thus, to lowest order, a CO$_2$ beam in a tokamak plasma
propagates as a transverse electromagnetic wave
($\vect{k} \cdot \vect{E}_0 \approx 0$)
with near-constant polarization.

Finally, it should be noted for completeness that
while cold-plasma theory is adequate for the current purposes,
finite-temperature and relativistic effects
will affect the interpretation of refractive index measurements
in a fusion reactor.
For example, the thermal correction
to the cold-plasma interferometric phase
in a $T_e \approx 10 \, \text{keV}$ plasma is $-3\%$,
with slightly more substantial corrections for
polarimetric measurements~\cite{mirnov_07}.


\subsection{Wave propagation in an inhomogeneous medium}
\label{sec:InterferometricMethods:EM_waves_in_plasma:propagation_in_inhomogeneous_medium}
No physical plasma is truly homogeneous in space.
While the above Fourier approach can still be employed,
the inhomogeneities tend to couple the various modes together,
greatly complicating the analysis.
However, if the plasma varies sufficiently slowly,
the plasma can be treated as \emph{locally} uniform, and
the wave field can be ``stitched'' together
as the wave propagates from initial position $\vect{r}^{(i)}$
to position $\vect{r}$ via the WKB approximation
\cite[Ch.~13]{stix}\cite[Ch.~8]{griffiths_QM}
\begin{equation}
  E(\vect{r}, t)
  \approx
  E_0 \exp \left[i \left(%
    \int_{\vect{r}^{(i)}}^{\vect{r}} \vect{k}(\vect{r}') \cdot d\vect{l}'
    -
    \omega t
  \right) \right].
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:WKB_field}
\end{equation}
Here, $\vect{k}(\vect{r}')$ is the local wavevector and
the integration is performed along the wave's trajectory.
Note that the amplitude variation and the reflected wave
that are characteristic of the WKB approximation
have been neglected because densities in a tokamak plasma
are much less than a CO$_2$ beam's
$\sim \SI{e25}{\per\meter\cubed}$ density cutoff.

What exactly is meant by ``sufficiently slowly'', though?
To approximate the plasma as locally uniform,
the change in the wavenumber $\delta k$ over one wavelength $\lambda$
should be small relative to the wavenumber $k$.
Note that the change in wavenumber over one wavelength is
$\delta k = \nabla k \cdot \lambda = 2 \pi \nabla k / k$.
Thus, the WKB validity criterion that $\delta k / k \ll 1$ becomes
\begin{equation}
  \frac{|\nabla k|}{k^2} \ll \frac{1}{2 \pi}.
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:WKB_validity}
\end{equation}
Now, using the definition of $N$ from
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:refraction_index}),
the cold-plasma index of refraction in
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:index_of_refraction})
can be rewritten as $k = (\omega / c) (1 - X / 2)$, and, to lowest order,
\begin{equation}
  \nabla k
  \approx
  -\left( \frac{2 \pi \, r_e}{k} \right) \nabla n_e,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  r_e
  =
  \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 m_e c^2}
  =
  \SI{2.8e-15}{\meter}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:classical_electron_radius}
\end{equation}
is the classical electron radius.
The most extreme density gradients in a tokamak
often occur in the so-called ``pedestal'',
where the density changes by
$\Delta n_e \lesssim \SI{e20}{\per\meter\cubed}$
over a scale length $\Delta r \gtrsim \SI{1}{\centi\meter}$;
for a CO$_2$ laser beam ($k = \SI{5.9e5}{\per\meter}$)
propagating through such a pedestal,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{|\nabla k|}{k^2}
  =
  \left( \frac{2 \pi \, r_e}{k^3} \right) |\nabla n_e|
  \lesssim
  10^{-9}
  \notag
\end{equation}
such that the criterion for WKB validity
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:WKB_validity})
is very well-satisfied.
The WKB validity criterion can also be evaluated
for a CO$_2$ beam propagating through plasma-density fluctuations;
assuming $\tilde{n}_e / \bar{n}_e \sim 10^{-3}$,
$\bar{n}_e \lesssim \SI{e20}{\per\meter\cubed}$, and
density-fluctuation wavenumbers $\lesssim \SI{30}{\per\centi\meter}$,
$|\nabla k| / k^2 \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-11}$ such that
the WKB validity criterion is also very well-satisfied
for typical plasma-density fluctuations.


\subsection{Plasma-induced phase delay}
\label{sec:InterferometricMethods:EM_waves_in_plasma:plasma_induced_phase_delay}
The WKB field solution (\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:WKB_field})
indicates that the wave's phase at a given point in space and time
is determined by the properties of the medium
that the wave has passed through.
In particular, a CO$_2$ laser beam propagating through a tokamak plasma
will acquire a phase shift $\phi$ relative to vacuum given by
\begin{align}
  \phi
  &=
  \int \left[ k(\vect{r}) - \frac{\omega}{c} \right] dl
  \notag \\
  &=
  \frac{\omega}{c} \int \left[ N(\vect{r}) - 1 \right] dl
  \notag \\
  &\approx
  \frac{\omega}{c}
  \int \left[%
    \left( 1 - \frac{X}{2} \right) - 1
  \right] dl
  \notag \\
  &=
  -r_e \lambda_0 \int n_e dl,
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:phase}
\end{align}
where the index of refraction has been approximated via
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:index_of_refraction}),
$\lambda_0 = 2 \pi c / \omega = \SI{10.6}{\micro\meter}$
is the CO$_2$ beam's vacuum wavelength, and
$r_e$ is again the classical electron radius
defined in (\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:classical_electron_radius}).
Now, if the plasma fluctuates about its equilibrium density $\bar{n}_e$ as
$n_e = \bar{n}_e + \tilde{n}_e$,
the phase will similarly fluctuate about its equilibrium as
$\phi = \bar{\phi} + \tilde{\phi}$ where
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\phi}
  =
  - r_e \lambda_0 \int \tilde{n}_e dl.
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:phase_fluctuation}
\end{equation}
It is precisely the intent of
Section~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:Gaussian_beam_diffraction}
to determine how such density fluctuations
interact with an incident Gaussian probe beam.
As a final note before leaving this section,
accurate interpretation of very rapid phase-fluctuation measurements
(such as those resulting from RF-wave perturbations)
may require accounting for the beam's finite transit time
through the plasma to the point of measurement
\cite[Sec.~3.1]{tsujii_phd}.


\section{Diffraction of a Gaussian probe beam}
\label{sec:InterferometricMethods:Gaussian_beam_diffraction}
Lasers are almost always well-collimated enough that
they are amenable to analysis in the paraxial limit.
Gaussian beams are exact solutions
to the paraxial wave equation in free space, and
they are very good approximations
to the eigenmodes observed in real lasers~\cite[Ch.~16]{siegman_lasers}.
For this reason, it is reasonable to investigate
the interaction of a Gaussian probe beam
with a plasma-density fluctuation.


\subsection{Definition of a Gaussian beam}
\label{sec:InterferometricMethods:Gaussian_beam_diffraction:Gaussian_beam_definition}
A Gaussian beam of angular frequency $\omega_0$
propagating along the $z$-axis
in a medium with index of refraction $N$
has an electric field
\begin{equation}
  E_G(\vect{r}, t)
  =
  E_G(\vect{r}) e^{-i \omega_0 t}
\end{equation}
with spatial dependence~\cite[Ch.~17]{siegman_lasers}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    E_G(\vect{r})
    &=
    E_0
    \frac{w_0}{w(z)}
    \exp\left[ \frac{-\rho^2}{w(z)^2} \right]
    \\
    &\quad\times
    \exp\left\{ i \left[
      N k_0 z
      +
      \frac{N k_0 \rho^2}{2 R(z)}
      -
      \psi(z) \right] \right\}.
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Gaussian_beam}
\end{equation}
Here,
$\rho = (x^2 + y^2)^{1/2}$ is the transverse distance
from the $z$-axis (i.e.\ the beam's ``symmetry axis''),
$w_0$ is the radius of the beam's waist, and
$k_0 = \omega_0 / c = 2 \pi / \lambda_0$
is the beam's vacuum wavenumber.
The beam's width $w(z)$, radius of curvature $R(z)$, and
Gouy phase $\psi(z)$ are defined as
\begin{align}
  w(z)
  &=
  w_0 \left[ 1 + \left( \frac{z}{z_R} \right)^2 \right]^{1/2},
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Gaussian_beam_width}
  \\
  R(z)
  &=
  z \left[ 1 + \left( \frac{z_R}{z} \right)^2 \right],
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Gaussian_beam_radius_of_curvature}
  \\
  \psi(z)
  &=
  \atan\left( \frac{z}{z_R} \right),
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Gouy_phase}
\end{align}
where the Rayleigh range
\begin{equation}
  z_R \equiv \left( \frac{\pi w_0^2}{\lambda_0} \right) N
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Rayleigh_range}
\end{equation}
is the nominal division between the beam's
near-field ($|z| \ll z_R$) and far-field ($|z| \gg z_R$) behaviors.
Note that the beam's waist sits at $z = 0$.

From a Fourier perspective,
a Gaussian beam can be decomposed into a set of infinite plane waves
traveling in slightly different directions \cite[Ch.~16.7]{siegman_lasers}.
The plane waves with the beam's nominal wavevector
$\vect{k}_0 = k_0 \hat{\vect{z}}$
propagate along the beam's symmetry axis, while
the plane waves with non-zero transverse wavevectors
produce beam divergence (i.e.\ free-space diffraction of the beam).
This behavior can be understood as an uncertainty principle, with
the beam's finite transverse dimensions
necessarily requiring a finite spread in transverse wavevectors.


\subsection{Diffraction of a Gaussian beam from plasma-density fluctuations}
\label{sec:InterferometricMethods:Gaussian_beam_diffraction:from_plasma_density_fluctuations}
As discussed in the text surrounding
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:electric_field_eigenvector}),
a CO$_2$ probe beam in a tokamak plasma propagates
as a transverse electromagnetic wave with near-constant polarization
(any small changes to the beam polarization
are of little practical interest to the present work).
Thus, a \emph{scalar} diffraction theory is sufficient
to describe the relevant aspects of the beam-plasma interaction;
the details of this theory are provided in
Appendix~\ref{app:GaussianBeamDiffraction}, and
the relevant results are summarized below.

A Gaussian CO$_2$ probe beam
propagating through a tokamak plasma
acquires a plasma-induced phase delay $\phi(\vect{\rho}', t)$
given by (\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:phase}),
where $\vect{\rho}'$ corresponds to the beam's transverse dimensions.
Explicitly dividing $\phi$ into bulk $\bar{\phi}(t)$ and
spatially varying $\tilde{\phi}(\vect{\rho}', t)$ components,
the plasma-induced phase delay becomes
\begin{equation}
  \phi(\vect{\rho}', t) = \bar{\phi}(t) + \tilde{\phi}(\vect{\rho}', t).
\end{equation}
Typically, $\tilde{\phi}$ varies on much faster time scales than $\bar{\phi}$,
but this is not required.
The spatial variation of the plasma-induced phase delay
contributes to the diffraction of the incident Gaussian probe beam.

The response functions of the diagnostics investigated in
Sections~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:interferometry} and
\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:pci} will be shown
to be linear in their regimes of relevance, so
it is sufficient to examine diffraction
from phase fluctuations $\tilde{\phi}$
consisting of a single Fourier mode
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\phi}(\vect{\rho}', t) = \tilde{\phi}_0 \cos(k x' - \omega t).
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:cosine_phase_fluctuation}
\end{equation}
Here, without loss of generality,
it is assumed that the CO$_2$ probe beam
is propagating in the $+z$-direction, and
the density fluctuation corresponding to $\tilde{\phi}$
is propagating in the $x$-direction.
Then, following the formalism pioneered by Raman and Nath
\cite{raman_nath_diffraction_partI,raman_nath_diffraction_partIII} and
detailed in Appendix~\ref{app:GaussianBeamDiffraction},
the diffracted electric field can be written
(see (\ref{eq:GaussianBeamDiffraction:phase_modulated_Gaussian_beam_diffraction}))
as a discrete sum of scattered beams
\begin{equation}
  E(\vect{r}, t)
  \approx
  e^{i \bar{\phi}}
  \sum_{m = -1}^{1}
  i^m \left[ J_m(\tilde{\phi}_0) \right]
  E_G(\vect{r}_m)
  e^{-i (\omega_0 + m \omega) t},
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:phase_modulated_Gaussian_beam_diffraction}
\end{equation}
where
$J_m$ is the $m$\ts{th} Bessel function of the first kind and
$E_G(\vect{r}_m)$ is the spatial dependence of the $m$\ts{th} scattered beam.
Note that $\vect{r}_m = [ \vect{R}(\theta_m) ] \vect{r}$
is the native coordinate system
of the $m$\ts{th} scattered beam
expressed in lab-frame coordinates;
here, $\theta_m \approx mk / k_0$ is the angle
at which the $m$\ts{th} scattered beam propagates
relative to the lab-frame optical axis, and
\begin{equation}
  \vect{R}(\theta)
  =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos\theta & 0 & -\sin\theta
    \\
    0          & 1 & 0
    \\
    \sin\theta & 0 & \cos\theta
  \end{pmatrix}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:rotation_matrix}
\end{equation}
is the rotation matrix
that rotates the $(x, z)$-plane about the $y$-axis by angle $\theta$.

It is worth pausing to discuss the physical significance
of the diffracted electric field
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:phase_modulated_Gaussian_beam_diffraction}).
The assumed sinusoidal phase modulation
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:cosine_phase_fluctuation})
diffracts an incident Gaussian beam
predominantly into downscattered ($m = -1$), unscattered ($m = 0$), and
upscattered ($m = 1$) Gaussian beams.
The incident beam is coupled into the $m$\ts{th} scattered beam
with strength $J_m(\tilde{\phi}_0)$.
The $m$\ts{th} scattered beam is Doppler shifted
relative to the incident beam by $m \omega$ and
propagates at an angle $\theta_m \approx m k / k_0$
relative to the lab-frame optical axis.
The scattering is very nearly elastic
(i.e.\
$\omega / \omega_0
\lesssim
\SI{1}{\giga\hertz} / \SI{28.3}{\tera\hertz}
\sim 10^{-5}$), so
$|\vect{k}_{0,m}| = k_0$ is a very good approximation.
This constraint of elasticity
coupled with knowledge of the scattering angle $\theta_m$
allows determination of the scattered wavevector
\begin{equation}
  \vect{k}_{0,m}
  =
  (m k) \hat{\vect{x}}
  +
  k_0 \left[ 1 - \left(\frac{m k}{k_0}\right)^2 \right]^{1/2} \hat{\vect{z}}.
  %k_0 \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m k}{k_0}\right)^2} \hat{\vect{z}}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:scattered_beam_wavevector}
\end{equation}
Finally, note that the simultaneous presence
of both the upscattered and downscattered beams
(a key prediction of the Raman-Nath formalism)
under typical experimental conditions
has been demonstrated empirically
\cite[Sec.~2.1]{dorris_phd}.


\subsection{Wavenumber filtering of the diffracted field}
Some interferometric techniques, such as phase contrast imaging
(PCI; discussed in Section~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:pci}),
filter the Fourier wavenumber content
of the diffracted electric field
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:phase_modulated_Gaussian_beam_diffraction}).
The mathematical formalism for such filtering is detailed in
Appendix~\ref{app:GaussianBeamDiffraction}, but
the relevant results are briefly summarized here.
Assume that the filtering can be described by a transfer function $T(k_x)$,
where $k_x$ is the wavevector component in the lab-frame $x$-direction.
Then, the filtered electric field can be written
(see (\ref{eq:GaussianBeamDiffraction:phase_modulated_Gaussian_beam_diffraction_Fourier_filtered}))
as
\begin{equation}
  E(\vect{r}, t)
  \approx
  e^{i \bar{\phi}}
  \sum_{m = -1}^{1}
  i^m \left[ J_m(\tilde{\phi}_0) \right]
  E_T(\vect{r}_m)
  e^{-i (\omega_0 + m \omega) t},
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:phase_modulated_Gaussian_beam_diffraction_Fourier_filtered}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  E_T(\vect{r}_m)
  \approx
  E_G(0, y_m, z_m)
  \cdot
  \mathcal{E}(\vect{r}_m, k),
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:mth_diffracted_beam_kx_filtered_compact}
\end{equation}
is the $m$\ts{th} scattered beam
following the wavenumber-filtering transformation, and
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{E}(\vect{r}_m, k)
    &=
    \frac{e^{-i m k x_m}}{2 \pi}
    \\
    &\quad \times
    \int dx' \,
    \exp\left[ \frac{-x'^2}{w(z_m)^2} \right]
    \exp\left\{%
      i \left[%
        m k x'
        +
        \frac{k_0 x'^2}{2 R(z_m)}
      \right]
    \right\}
    \\
    &\quad \times
    \int dk_x \,
    T(k_x)
    e^{i k_x (x_m - x')}
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:mth_diffracted_beam_kx_filtered_transformation}
\end{equation}
is a complex-valued function
that describes the amplitude and phase transformations
that result from filtering the $m$\ts{th} scattered beam by $T(k_x)$.
When there is no wavenumber filtering (i.e. $T(k_x) = 1$),
the $m$\ts{th} transformed beam
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:mth_diffracted_beam_kx_filtered_compact})
readily reduces to the $m$\ts{th} scattered Gaussian beam
(i.e.\ $E_T(\vect{r}_m) = E_G(\vect{r}_m)$),
in agreement with expectations.


\section{Imaging of the diffracted field}
\label{sec:InterferometricMethods:imaging}
It is often desirable to \emph{image} the above diffracted field
in order to determine the spatiotemporal aspects
of the responsible phase fluctuations.
Below, the relevant aspects of imaging systems are briefly reviewed.
The imaged field is then computed and
examined under typical experimental limits.


\subsection{Imaging systems}
Appendix~\ref{app:ImagingSystems} details
the geometric optics and Gaussian-beam transformations
of relevance to imaging systems;
here, the directly applicable aspects
are briefly summarized.

Let the optical axis of an arbitrary optical system lie along the $z$-axis,
and let all optical rays lie in a plane with the optical axis.
At a given position $z_j$, an optical ray is fully described by
its transverse distance $\rho$ to the optical axis and
its slope $d\rho / dz$~\cite[Ch.~15]{siegman_lasers}.
An imaging system $\image$, by definition,
redirects all rays emanating from transverse position $\rho_{\object}$
in the object plane $S_{\object}$
to intersect at transverse position
\begin{equation}
  \rho_{\image} = M \rho_{\object}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:image_plane_transverse_coordinates}
\end{equation}
in the image plane $S_{\image}$.
Here, $M$ is the \emph{magnification} of the imaging system, and
$M < 0$ implies that the image is inverted relative to the object.
Because the symmetry axis of a Gaussian beam
behaves as a ray in the geometric-optics sense
\cite{tovar_generalized_beam_matrices_IV},
the symmetry axes of the unscattered and scattered beams
intersect in the image plane.
Then, varying inversely with the spatial scale,
the wavenumber $k$ of the object-plane phase fluctuation
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:cosine_phase_fluctuation})
is imaged as
\begin{equation}
  k_{\image} \equiv \frac{k}{M}.
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:image_plane_fluctuation_wavenumber}
\end{equation}
The native coordinate systems
of the $m$\ts{th} scattered beam and the unscattered beam
do \emph{not} align in the image plane
(i.e.\ $\vect{r}_{m,\image} \neq \vect{r}_{\image}$).
Considerations from geometric and Gaussian-beam optics
show that the image-plane coordinate systems are related as
\begin{equation}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    x_{m, \image}
    \\
    y_{m, \image}
    \\
    z_{m, \image}
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    x_{\image} \cos\left( \frac{\theta_m}{M} \right)
    \\
    y_{\image}
    \\
    z_{\image} + x_{\image} \sin\left( \frac{\theta_m}{M} \right)
  \end{pmatrix}
  \approx
  \begin{pmatrix}
    x_{\image}
    \\
    y_{\image}
    \\
    z_{\image} + x_{\image} \left( \frac{\theta_m}{M} \right)
  \end{pmatrix},
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:coordinate_transformation_imaging_plane}
\end{equation}
where the approximation is valid to first order in $\theta_m / M$.


\subsection{The imaged field}
Let $\image$ image the object plane $S_{\object}$
such that the diffracted field
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:phase_modulated_Gaussian_beam_diffraction_Fourier_filtered})
is imaged as
\begin{align}
  E(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  &=
  \image[ E(\vect{r}_{\object}, t) ]
  \notag \\
  &\begin{aligned}
    =
    e^{i \bar{\phi}}
    \sum_{m = -1}^{1}
    \biggl\{%
      &i^m \left[ J_m(\tilde{\phi}_0) \right]
      \\
      &\times
      \image[E_T(\vect{r}_{m, \object})]
      e^{-i (\omega_0 + m \omega) t}
    \biggr\},
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:imaged_total_field_v1}
\end{align}
where the $\image$ operator has been brought within the summation
because the scattered beams obey the superposition principle
when propagating through the imaging system
(it is assumed that typical beam intensities are far from
any nonlinear thresholds in the imaging-system materials).
The effect of $\image$ is to propagate each scattered beam
from its object-plane coordinates $\vect{r}_{m, \object}$
to its corresponding image-plane coordinates $\vect{r}_{m, \image}$.
Thus, referencing the definition of $E_T(\vect{r}_{m})$ in
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:mth_diffracted_beam_kx_filtered_compact}),
it readily follows that
\begin{align}
  \image[E_T(\vect{r}_{m, \object})]
  &=
  \mathcal{I}[%
    E_G(0, y_{m, \object}, z_{m, \object})
    \cdot
    \mathcal{E}(\vect{r}_{m, \object}, k)
  ]
  \notag \\
  &=
  E_G(0, y_{m, \image}, z_{m, \image})
  \cdot
  \mathcal{E}(\vect{r}_{m, \image}, k_{\image})
  \notag \\
  &\approx
  E_G(0, y_{\image}, z_{\image})
  e^{i m k_{\image} x_{\image}}
  \cdot
  \mathcal{E}(\vect{r}_{m, \image}, k_{\image}),
\end{align}
where the last step naturally follows from
the image-plane coordinate transformation
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:coordinate_transformation_imaging_plane})
and the following approximations:
$w(z_{m, \image}) \approx w(z_{\image})$,
$R(z_{m, \image}) \approx R(z_{\image})$, and
$\psi(z_{m, \image}) \approx \psi(z_{\image})$.
Thus, the imaged field
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:imaged_total_field_v1}) becomes
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    E(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
    &=
    E_G(0, y_{\image}, z_{\image}, t)
    e^{i \bar{\phi}}
    \\
    &\quad \times
    \sum_{m = -1}^{1}
    i^m \left[ J_m(\tilde{\phi}_0) \right]
    \mathcal{E}(\vect{r}_{m, \image}, k_{\image})
    e^{i m \nu},
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:imaged_total_field}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \nu
  =
  k_{\image} x_{\image} - \omega t
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:image_plane_nu}
\end{equation}
and
$E_G(0, y_{\image}, z_{\image}, t)
=
E_G(0, y_{\image}, z_{\image}) e^{-i \omega_0 t}$.


\subsection{The weak-coupling limit}
\label{sec:InterferometricMethods:imaging:weak_coupling_limit}
Typically, the phase-fluctuation amplitude
is very small ($\tilde{\phi}_0 \ll 1$), and
the Bessel function's small-argument limiting form \cite{abramowitz_and_stegun}
can be used
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{z \rightarrow 0} J_m(z)
  \sim
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{\Gamma(m + 1)} \left( \frac{z}{2} \right)^m
    , \qquad
    &m = 0, 1, 2, 3, \cdots,
    \\
    \frac{1}{\Gamma(|m| + 1)} \left( \frac{-z}{2} \right)^{|m|}
    , \qquad
    &m = -1, -2, -3, \cdots.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Here, $\Gamma$ is the gamma function, and
$\Gamma(m + 1) = m!$ for positive integer $m$.
Introducing the notational shorthand
$\mathcal{E}_m \equiv \mathcal{E}(\vect{r}_{m, \image}, k_{\image})$,
the imaged field to first order in $\tilde{\phi}_0$
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:imaged_total_field}) becomes
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  E(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  &\approx
  E_G(0, y_{\image}, z_{\image}, t)
  e^{i \bar{\phi}}
  \\
  &\quad\times
  \biggl\{%
    \mathcal{E}_{0}
    +
    i \frac{\tilde{\phi}_0}{2}
    \left[
      \mathcal{E}_{1} e^{i \nu}
      +
      \mathcal{E}_{-1} e^{-i \nu}
    \right]
  \biggr\}.
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:imaged_total_field_weak_coupling_Fourier_filtered}
\end{equation}

When there is no wavenumber filtering of the diffracted field
(i.e.\ $T(k_x) = 1$), the imaged field
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:imaged_total_field_weak_coupling_Fourier_filtered})
readily reduces to
\begin{equation}
  E(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  \approx
  E_G(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  e^{i \bar{\phi}}
  \left[%
    1
    +
    i \tilde{\phi}_0 \cos\nu
  \right],
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:imaged_total_field_monochromatic_fluctuation_weak_coupling}
\end{equation}
which follows naturally from the image-plane coordinate transformation
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:coordinate_transformation_imaging_plane})
and the following approximations:
$w(z_{m, \image}) \approx w(z_{\image})$ and
$R(z_{m, \image}) \approx R(z_{\image})$.
Note that
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:imaged_total_field_monochromatic_fluctuation_weak_coupling})
is \emph{linear} in the imaged phase fluctuation $\tilde{\phi}_0 \cos\nu$.
By the principle of linear superposition, then,
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:imaged_total_field_monochromatic_fluctuation_weak_coupling})
can be readily generalized to
\begin{equation}
  E(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  \approx
  E_G(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  e^{i \bar{\phi}}
  \left[%
    1
    +
    i \tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t)
  \right],
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:imaged_total_field_broadband_fluctuation_weak_coupling}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{\phi}(x, t)$ is a real-valued but
otherwise arbitrary phase fluctuation.


\subsection{The need for a reference beam}
\label{sec:InterferometricMethods:imaging:need_for_reference_beam}
Assume that there is
no wavenumber filtering of the diffracted field
such that
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:imaged_total_field_broadband_fluctuation_weak_coupling})
yields the imaged field.
Now, most detectors of interest are square-law detectors
in that they produce a response proportional to
the square (i.e.\ intensity) of the impinging field.
If such a detector is placed at the image plane,
the local intensity (averaged over an optical cycle) is
\begin{align}
  I(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  &\equiv
  \frac{c \varepsilon_0}{2} |E(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)|^2
  \notag \\
  &=
  I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})
  \left[%
    1
    +
    \mathcal{O}\left( \left[\tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t)\right]^2 \right)
  \right],
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:imaged_field_intensity}
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
  I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})
  =
  \frac{c \varepsilon_0 |E_G(\vect{r}_{\image})|^2}{2}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Gaussian_beam_intensity}
\end{equation}
is the intensity profile (averaged over an optical cycle)
of the unscattered Gaussian beam.
Thus, for the typical $|\tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t)| \ll 1$ limit,
the measured response will be very weak
if the detector is only exposed to the imaged radiation.
Physically, this is attributable to the $m = \pm 1$ beams
being $\pi / 2$ out of phase with the unscattered $m = 0$ beam.
As will be shown in Sections
\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:interferometry} and
\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:pci},
the system response can be substantially improved
by interfering the scattered beams with a reference beam.
The generation of such a reference beam, then, is the trait
that differentiates one interferometric method from another.


\section{External reference-beam interferometry}
\label{sec:InterferometricMethods:interferometry}
In external reference-beam interferometry,
there is no wavenumber filtering of the diffracted field
such that
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:imaged_total_field_broadband_fluctuation_weak_coupling})
yields the imaged field.
Thus, the probe radiation in the image plane is given as
\begin{equation}
  E_P(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  \approx
  E_G(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  e^{i \bar{\phi}}
  \left[%
    1
    +
    i \tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t)
  \right].
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:imaged_total_field_interferometer}
\end{equation}
Now, assume that the imaged probe radiation
is interfered with a reference beam of known phase $\phi_R$
\begin{equation}
  E_R(\vect{r}_{\image}, t) = E_G(\vect{r}_{\image}, t) e^{i \phi_R}.
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:external_reference_beam_arbitrary}
\end{equation}
The total field impinging on the detector is then
\begin{equation}
  E(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  =
  E_G(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  \left\{%
    e^{i \phi_R}
    +
    e^{i \bar{\phi}}
    \left[%
      1
      +
      i \tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t)
    \right]
  \right\},
\end{equation}
and, to first order in $\tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t)$,
the corresponding intensity (averaged over an optical cycle) is
\begin{equation}
  I(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  =
  2 I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})
  \left[%
    1
    +
    \cos(\phi_R - \bar{\phi})
    +
    \tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t) \sin(\phi_R - \bar{\phi})
  \right],
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:interferometer_intensity_arbitrary_reference}
\end{equation}
where $I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})$ is
the intensity profile of the unscattered Gaussian beam on the detector
as defined in (\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:Gaussian_beam_intensity}).
Reference-beam generation prescribes $\phi_R$ and
consequently dictates the method of interferometric detection.


\subsection{Homodyne detection}
\label{sec:InterferometricMethods:interferometry:homodyne}
Homodyne detection results from using
a reference phase $\phi_R$ that is constant (or nearly constant) in time
such that the resulting intensity is
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    I_{\text{hom}}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
    =
    2 I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})
    \bigl[%
      1
      &+
      \cos(\phi_R - \bar{\phi})
      \\
      &+
      \tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t)
      \sin(\phi_R - \bar{\phi})
    \bigr].
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:homodyne_intensity}
\end{equation}
The homodyne optical intensity can be explicitly separated
into equilibrium and fluctuating components as
$I_{\text{hom}} = \bar{I}_{\text{hom}} + \tilde{I}_{\text{hom}}$,
where
\begin{align}
  \bar{I}_{\text{hom}}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  &=
  2 I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})
  \left[ 1 + \cos(\phi_R - \bar{\phi})] \right],
  \\
  \tilde{I}_{\text{hom}}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  &=
  2 I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})
  \cdot
  \sin(\phi_R - \bar{\phi})
  \cdot
  \tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t).
\end{align}
Note that both $\bar{I}_{\text{hom}}$ and $\tilde{I}_{\text{hom}}$
are functions of the phase difference $\phi_R - \bar{\phi}$.
If measurement of the fluctuation $\tilde{\phi}$ is of primary importance,
$|\tilde{I}_{\text{hom}}|$ should be maximized,
which occurs when $\phi_R - \bar{\phi} = \pi / 2 + m \pi$ for integer $m$.
For concreteness in the following discussion,
take $\phi_R - \bar{\phi} = \pi / 2$.
Physically, $\phi_R - \bar{\phi} = \pi / 2$
means that the reference beam is
out-of-phase with the unscattered beam but
in-phase with the scattered beams.
Note that interfering the scattered beams with this in-phase reference beam
produces an intensity linear in $\tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t)$;
this should be contrasted with the weak, quadratic intensity variation
of (\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:imaged_field_intensity})
that occurs in the absence of a reference beam.

Now, a typical engineering constraint of such an interferometer
is the saturation intensity of the detector elements.
Beyond the linear saturation intensity $I_{\text{sat}}$,
the detector's response ceases to be a linear function
of the incident optical power.
To make an ``apples-to-apples'' comparison of different interference schemes,
it is useful to examine the ratio
of the fluctuating intensity $\tilde{I}_{\text{hom}}$
to the saturation intensity $I_{\text{sat}}$.
Because $|\tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t)| \ll 1$
\begin{align}
  I_{\text{hom}}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  &\approx
  \bar{I}_{\text{hom}}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  \leq
  2 I_G(0)
  \quad \text{when} \quad
  \phi_R - \bar{\phi} = \frac{\pi}{2},
  \notag
\end{align}
where $I_G(0) = I_G(\rho_{\image} = 0, z_{\image})$ is convenient shorthand
for the peak intensity of the unscattered Gaussian probe beam at the detector.
To obtain optimal performance,
select $I_G(0)$ such that
\begin{equation}
  I_{\text{sat}}
  =
  2 I_G(0).
  \notag
\end{equation}
Then, the fraction of the detector's dynamic range
occupied by the fluctuating signal is
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\tilde{I}_{\text{hom}}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)}{I_{\text{sat}}}
  =
  \frac{I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})}{I_G(0)}
  \cdot
  T_{\text{hom}}
  \cdot
  \tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  T_{\text{hom}}
  \equiv
  1
  \quad \text{when} \quad
  \phi_R - \bar{\phi} = \frac{\pi}{2}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:homodyne_interferometer_wavenumber_transfer_function}
\end{equation}
is the homodyne interferometer's transfer function.
As presented here,
$T_{\text{hom}}$ is independent of the fluctuation wavenumber;
however, the finite sampling-volume effects
that accompany any real-world measurement
introduce a wavenumber dependence,
as discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:DesignConsiderations:geometric:finite_sampling_volume}.

The above derivation of the homodyne interferometer's transfer function
requires $\phi_R - \bar{\phi} = \pi / 2$.
Practically speaking, however,
it can be difficult to keep $\phi_R - \bar{\phi}$ fixed at $\pi / 2$.
First, a CO$_2$ beam passing through $\sim \SI{1}{\meter}$
of plasma with a density $n_e \sim \SI{e20}{\per\meter\cubed}$
will experience a bulk phase delay $\bar{\phi} \sim \pi$;
thus, for constant $\phi_R$, it will be impossible
to operate the interferometer at
$\phi_R - \bar{\phi} = \pi / 2$
as the density evolves across the discharge.
Second, fusion experiments are often characterized
by large, pulsed electromagnets
whose vibrations can change the path lengths of the interferometer's arms.
A path-length change $\delta l$ produces
$\delta(\phi_R - \bar{\phi}) = k_0 \delta l$,
where $k_0$ is the wavenumber of the probe radiation.
For a $\SI{10.6}{\micro\meter}$ CO$_2$ probe beam,
a path-length variation $\sim \SI{2.5}{\micro\meter}$
is sufficient to produce $\delta(\phi_R - \bar{\phi}) \sim \pi / 2$,
pushing the homodyne interferometer from
its configuration of peak fluctuation sensitivity into one of its nulls.
Even vacuum-pump vibrations can provide such a push!
On small fusion devices,
actively controlled mirrors have been used in an attempt
to account for the evolution of the equilibrium phase and
to cancel vibrational path-length changes,
minimizing excursions from $\phi_R - \bar{\phi} \approx \pi / 2$
\cite{nazikian_rsi87}, but
such an approach has not found application on larger
(and presumably more vibration-prone) fusion experiments.

In addition to its variable sensitivity,
the homodyne interferometer does \emph{not} make an absolute measurement
of the phase fluctuation amplitude $\tilde{\phi}_0$
\cite[Sec.~4.2.2]{hutchinson_diagnostics}.
For example, vibration-induced misalignment or
power fluctuations at the beam source
can alter the intensity $I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})$.
As a result, there are three potentially dynamic quantities:
$\{\phi_R - \bar{\phi}, \,
\tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t), \,
I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})\}$,
but there are only two measured quantities:
the equilibrium and fluctuating homodyne powers.
Thus, it is generally impossible to distinguish
whether changes in the amplitude of the fluctuating power
are attributable to real changes in $\tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t)$ or
are simply an artifact of the system alignment or radiation source.


\subsection{Heterodyne detection}
\label{sec:InterferometricMethods:interferometry:heterodyne}
To avoid the above-mentioned challenges of homodyne interferometry,
the reference phase can be linearly ramped in time
as $\phi_R = -\Delta \omega_0 t$ such that the intensity
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:interferometer_intensity_arbitrary_reference})
becomes
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    I_{\text{het}}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
    =
    2 I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})
    \bigl[%
      1
      &+
      \cos(\Delta \omega_0 t + \bar{\phi})
      \\
      &-
      \tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t)
      \sin(\Delta \omega_0 t + \bar{\phi})
    \bigr].
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:heterodyne_intensity}
\end{equation}
This approach is known as heterodyne interferometry,
as the desired baseband phase information is shifted
to an intermediate frequency $\Delta \omega_0$
satisfying $\omega_{\text{max}} \ll \Delta \omega_0 \ll \omega_0$,
where $\omega_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum angular frequency
in $\tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t)$.
Note that the dominant Fourier components of $I_{\text{het}}$
sit at the intermediate frequency $\pm \Delta \omega_0$ but that
the phase-fluctuation term
$\tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t) \sin(\Delta \omega_0 t + \bar{\phi})$
produces sidebands about $\pm \Delta \omega_0$;
sideband production for
a sinusoidal phase fluctuation of angular frequency $\omega$
is sketched in
Figure~\ref{fig:InterferometricMethods:baseband_vs_intermediate_frequency}.
Practically, the $\phi_R$ ramp is accomplished by modestly Doppler shifting
the reference beam relative to the plasma beam.
(Note that $\phi_R = -\Delta \omega_0 t$
corresponds to a Doppler \emph{upshifted} reference beam;
i.e.\ the reference beam's temporal evolution is given by
$e^{-i \omega_0 t + i \phi_R} = e^{-i(\omega_0 + \Delta\omega_0) t}$).

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{%
    Chapters/InterferometricMethods/figs/baseband_vs_intermediate_frequency.pdf}
  \caption[Schematic of homodyne vs.\ heterodyne signals in frequency space]{%
    Schematic of (a) homodyne vs.\ (b) heterodyne signals in frequency space.
    A homodyne signal is predominantly DC, and
    a sinusoidal fluctuation with angular frequency $\omega$
    produces sidebands at $\pm \omega$.
    In contrast, the power in a heterodyne signal is shifted
    to the intermediate frequencies $\pm \Delta \omega_0$, and
    a sinusoidal fluctuation with angular frequency $\omega$
    produces sidebands at $\Delta \omega_0 \pm \omega$ and
    $-\Delta \omega_0 \pm \omega$.}
  \label{fig:InterferometricMethods:baseband_vs_intermediate_frequency}
\end{figure}

The heterodyne interference signal must be demodulated
in order to retrieve the baseband phase-fluctuation information.
Practically speaking, dedicated analog or digital electronics
are used to demodulate the heterodyne signal;
however, for the pedagogical purposes of this section,
it is sufficient to consider the ``equivalent optical intensities''
corresponding to the demodulated signals.
The so-called in-phase ($I$) and quadrature ($Q$) signals
are obtained by mixing $I_{\text{het}}$ with
$(2 \sqrt{2} / \pi) \cdot \real(e^{-i \Delta\omega_0 t})$ and
$(2 \sqrt{2} / \pi) \cdot \imag(e^{-i \Delta\omega_0 t})$, respectively, and
low-pass filtering the resulting signals;
here, the normalization of the complex exponential
is motivated by and is consistent with the physical processes
that occur in a typical ring-diode double-balanced mixer, as discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:DesignConsiderations:demodulation:nonideal_mixing}, and,
for simplicity, low-pass filtering is implemented
by averaging over a cycle of the intermediate frequency.
Thus, the equivalent $I$ and $Q$ optical intensities are defined as
\begin{align}
  I_{I}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  +
  i \cdot I_{Q}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  &=
  \frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{\pi}
  \langle
  e^{-i \Delta \omega_0 t} \cdot I_{\text{het}}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  \rangle_{\Delta \omega_0}
  \notag \\
  &=
  \frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{\pi}
  I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})
  e^{i \bar{\phi}}
  \left[ 1 + i \tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t) \right],
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:heterodyne_interferometer_I_and_Q_intensity}
\end{align}
where $\langle q \rangle_{\Delta \omega_0}$ denotes
the average of quantity $q$ over an intermediate-frequency cycle as
\begin{equation}
  \langle q \rangle_{\Delta \omega_0}
  \equiv
  \frac{\Delta \omega_0}{2 \pi}
  \int_{0}^{\Delta \omega_0 / 2 \pi}
  q(t) dt.
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:intermediate_frequency_cycle_average}
\end{equation}

In contrast to the homodyne interferometer,
the heterodyne interferometer makes an absolute measurement
of the phase-fluctuation amplitude $\tilde{\phi}_0$.
To see this, note that $I_{I}$ and $I_{Q}$
(the real and imaginary components of
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:heterodyne_interferometer_I_and_Q_intensity}),
respectively)
can be separated into equilibrium and fluctuating components as
\begin{align}
  \bar{I}_{I}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  &=
  \frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{\pi}
  I_G(\vect{r}_{\image}) \cos\bar{\phi},
  \\
  \bar{I}_{Q}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  &=
  \frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{\pi}
  I_G(\vect{r}_{\image}) \sin\bar{\phi},
  \\
  \tilde{I}_{I}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  &=
  -\frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{\pi}
  I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})
  \sin\bar{\phi}
  \cdot
  \tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t),
  \\
  \tilde{I}_{Q}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  &=
  \frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{\pi}
  I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})
  \cos\bar{\phi}
  \cdot
  \tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t).
\end{align}
As is the case for the homodyne interferometer,
there are three potentially dynamic quantities:
$\{\bar{\phi}, \, \tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t), \, I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})\}$;
however, in contrast to the homodyne interferometer,
there are now \emph{four} measured quantities:
$\{\bar{I}_{I}, \, \bar{I}_{Q}, \, \tilde{I}_{I}, \, \tilde{I}_{Q}\}$.
Therefore, the number of measured quantities
is sufficient to unambiguously determine
$\{\bar{\phi}, \, \tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t), \, I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})\}$
in absolute units.

Finally, it is useful to characterize
the heterodyne interferometer's performance
relative to the saturation limits of a given detector.
Because $|\tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t)| \ll 1$, the heterodyne intensity
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:heterodyne_intensity})
can be approximated as
\begin{align}
  I_{\text{het}}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  &\approx
  2 I_G(\vect{r}_{\image}) [1 + \cos(\Delta \omega_0 t + \bar{\phi})]
  \notag \\
  &\leq
  4 I_G(0),
  \notag
\end{align}
where $I_G(0) = I_G(\rho_{\image} = 0, z_{\image})$ is convenient shorthand
for the peak intensity of the unscattered Gaussian probe beam at the detector.
To obtain optimal performance, select $I_G(0)$ such that
\begin{equation}
  I_{\text{sat}}
  =
  4 I_G(0).
  \notag
\end{equation}
Further, define the total fluctuating intensity
in the demodulated signals to be
\begin{align}
  \tilde{I}_{IQ}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  &\equiv
  \left\{%
    [\tilde{I}_{I}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)]^2
    +
    [\tilde{I}_{Q}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)]^2
  \right\}^{1/2}
  \notag \\
  &=
  \frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{\pi}
  I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})
  \cdot
  \tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t)
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:heterodyne_total_fluctuating_intensity}
\end{align}
such that the fraction of the detector's dynamic range
occupied by the fluctuating component in the demodulated signal is
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\tilde{I}_{IQ}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)}{I_{\text{sat}}}
  =
  \frac{I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})}{I_G(0)}
  \cdot
  T_{\text{het}}
  \cdot
  \tilde{\phi}(x_{\image}, t),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  T_{\text{het}}
  \equiv
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \pi}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:heterodyne_interferometer_wavenumber_transfer_function}
\end{equation}
is the heterodyne interferometer's transfer function.
As presented here,
$T_{\text{het}}$ is independent of the fluctuation wavenumber;
however, the finite sampling-volume effects
that accompany any real-world measurement
introduce a wavenumber dependence,
as discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:DesignConsiderations:geometric:finite_sampling_volume}.

In contrast to the homodyne interferometer,
the heterodyne interferometer's wavenumber transfer function
is \emph{not} a function of $\phi_R - \bar{\phi}$.
Thus, the heterodyne interferometer always operates at its peak sensitivity,
regardless of the bulk plasma phase or path-length vibrations.
Robust sensitivity comes at a cost, however.
Note that
\begin{equation}
  \frac{T_{\text{het}}}{T_{\text{hom}}}
  =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \pi}
  \quad
  \text{for homodyne operation at $\phi_R - \bar{\phi} = \pi / 2$.}
  \notag
\end{equation}
Thus, for a given detector,
a heterodyne interferometer will be
$(\sqrt{2} \cdot \pi)$ times \emph{less} sensitive
than a homodyne interferometer operated in its optimal configuration
($\phi_R - \bar{\phi} = \pi / 2$).
There are two physical origins
of the heterodyne interferometer's sensitivity deficit.
First, the detector of a homodyne interferometer
with $\phi_R - \bar{\phi} = \pi / 2$
only sees small fluctuations about a DC offset, while
the detector of a heterodyne interferometer sees
the full sinusoidal waveform of the intermediate frequency;
to ensure the detector is always within its saturation limits,
the heterodyne interferometer must necessarily be operated
with a mean intensity at the detector
that is a factor of two lower than that for the homodyne interferometer.
Second, a fraction of the power in
the heterodyne interferometer's fluctuating signal
(and its equilibrium signal) is lost during demodulation.


\section{Phase contrast imaging (PCI)}
\label{sec:InterferometricMethods:pci}
As discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:imaging:need_for_reference_beam},
imaging the probe radiation on a square-law detector
produces a very weak response
because the unscattered and scattered beams
are $\pi / 2$ out of phase with each other.
To produce a measurable response, a traditional interferometer
interferes the imaged radiation with an external reference beam.
If the phase of the unscattered beam could be manipulated, though,
the external reference beam would no longer be needed.
This is the approach employed in phase contrast imaging (PCI).
A typical PCI system is shown schematically in
Figure~\ref{fig:InterferometricMethods:pci_schematic}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 0.75 \textwidth]{%
    Chapters/InterferometricMethods/figs/pci_schematic.pdf}
  \caption[Schematic overview of a typical PCI system]{%
    Schematic overview of a typical PCI system.
    A plasma-density fluctuation weakly scatters an incident probe beam, and
    an off-axis parabolic mirror focuses the scattered and unscattered beams.
    An optical element known as a phase plate
    is placed at the focal plane of the parabolic mirror.
    The phase plate has a narrow groove of depth $\lambda_0 / 8$
    that imparts phase delay $\pi / 2$ to the unscattered beam,
    effectively converting the unscattered beam
    into an ``internal'' reference beam
    against which the scattered beams can be interfered.
    A lens, whose object plane sits at the plasma midplane,
    is then used to image the resulting radiation onto a detector array.}
  \label{fig:InterferometricMethods:pci_schematic}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Reference-beam generation with a phase plate}
PCI uses an optical element known as a \emph{phase plate}
to delay the unscattered beam by $\pi / 2$
relative to the scattered beams.
The phase plate is typically a reflective optical element
with a groove that is precisely fabricated
to have a depth of $\lambda_0 / 8$;
the unscattered beam reflects off of this groove, and
the corresponding $\lambda_0 / 4$-increase in path length
phase delays the unscattered beam by $\pi / 2$
relative to the scattered beams,
which reflect off of the non-grooved portions
(i.e.\ the ``face'') of the phase plate.
To boost the relative size of the fluctuating signal,
the phase groove typically reflects only a fraction $\eta < 1$
of the incident unscattered beam power, while
the phase-plate face reflects all of the scattered beam power.
Thus, by the action of the phase plate,
$1 \rightarrow i \sqrt{\eta}$ in the imaged electric field
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:imaged_total_field_monochromatic_fluctuation_weak_coupling})
such that
\begin{equation}
  E_{\text{PCI}}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  =
  i E_G(\vect{r}_{\image}, t) e^{i \bar{\phi}}
  \left[%
    \sqrt{\eta} + \tilde{\phi}_0 \cos\nu
  \right],
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:pci_imaged_field}
\end{equation}
and the corresponding intensity,
averaged over an optical cycle and
to first order in $\tilde{\phi}_0$, is
\begin{equation}
  I_{\text{PCI}}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  =
  I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})
  \left[%
    \eta
    +
    2 \sqrt{\eta} \tilde{\phi}_0 \cos\nu
  \right].
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:pci_intensity}
\end{equation}
Here, $E_G(\vect{r}_{\image})$ and $I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})$
are the field and intensity profiles
of the unscattered Gaussian beam on the detector
in the \emph{absence} of the phase plate,
with $I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})$ being explicitly defined in
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:Gaussian_beam_intensity}).
Equation
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:pci_intensity})
should be contrasted with
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:imaged_field_intensity}),
which gives the image-plane intensity
in the absence of the phase plate.
Thus, the phase plate converts the unscattered probe beam
into an effective reference beam for the scattered beams.


\subsection{Focal-plane separation of scattered beams}
Implicit in the use of the phase plate
is that the scattered and unscattered beams
are well-separated in space
such that the phase groove only affects the unscattered beam.
The 1\ts{st}-order scattered beams are angularly separated
from the unscattered beam by $\theta = k / k_0$, and,
in the far field ($z \gg z_R$),
the center of the scattered beam will fall outside of
the unscattered beam's 1/e $E$ radius if
\begin{equation}
  |k| \geq \frac{2}{w_0}.
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:kmin_for_far_field_beam_separation}
\end{equation}
However, CO$_2$ laser beams used to probe tokamak plasmas often have
$z_R \gg \SI{10}{\meter}$, so
the beam's far field is not easily accessible in typical lab settings.
Fortunately, the far-field diffraction pattern
can be equivalently accessed in the focal plane
of a focusing optic~\cite[Ch.~8]{born_and_wolf}.

The focal-plane location, beam size, and beam separation
can be easily determined.
Let the Gaussian probe beam have
an in-vessel 1/e $E$ waist radius of $w_0$,
and place a focusing optic of focal length $f$
a distance $s$ downstream from the in-vessel beam waist.
Then, the waist of the focused beam
will be located a distance $s'$ downstream of the focusing optic
and will have 1/e $E$ radius $w_0'$ given as
\begin{align}
  s' &= f \left( 1 + \frac{s - f}{z_R} \right),
  \\
  w_0' &= \frac{w_0 |f|}{\left[ (s - f)^2 + z_R^2 \right]^{1/2}},
\end{align}
where $z_R$ is the in-vessel Rayleigh length~\cite{self83}.
When $|s - f| \ll z_R$, as is typical for PCI,
the expressions for $s'$ and $w_0'$ reduce to
\begin{align}
  s' &\approx f,
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:focal_plane_location_rayleigh}
  \\
  w_0' &\approx \frac{2 |f|}{k_0 w_0}.
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:focal_plane_waist_rayleigh}
\end{align}
The spatial separation $\Delta$
of the scattered and unscattered beams in the focal plane
is found by applying the appropriate $ABCD$ ray matrices
from Table~\ref{table:ImagingSystems:ABCD_matrices}
to a ray scattered in the plasma midplane by angle $\theta$, i.e.\
\begin{align}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \Delta
    \\
    \theta_{pp}
  \end{pmatrix}
  &=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & s'
    \\
    0 & 1
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1      & 0
    \\
    -1 / f & 1
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & s
    \\
    0 & 1
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0
    \\
    \theta
  \end{pmatrix},
  \notag
\end{align}
which, upon substitution of
of the focal plane location from
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:focal_plane_location_rayleigh}) and
the scattering angle $\theta = k / k_0$,
simplifies to
\begin{equation}
  \Delta
  \approx
  \frac{k f}{k_0}.
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:phase_plate_beam_separation}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Low-$k$ cutoff of phase plate}
Now, let the phase-plate groove have a width $d$, as is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:InterferometricMethods:phase_plate_beam_separation}.
Finite PCI response requires that (most of) the scattered beams
fall outside of the phase groove (i.e.\ $|\Delta| \geq d / 2$).
Application of the phase-plate beam-separation formula
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:phase_plate_beam_separation})
then shows that there will be finite PCI response
for $|k| \geq k_g$, where
\begin{equation}
  k_g \equiv \frac{k_0 d}{2 f}.
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:pci_kmin_engineering}
\end{equation}
Here, the subscript $g$ is in reference
to the \emph{groove} of the phase plate.
Further, to provide the strongest phase contrast,
the unscattered beam should fall wholly within the phase groove
(i.e.\ $2 w_0' \leq d$);
substituting (\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:focal_plane_waist_rayleigh})
for $w_0'$ then yields a constraint on the phase groove width
\begin{equation}
  d \geq \frac{4 f}{k_0 w_0},
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:phase_groove_constraint}
\end{equation}
and inserting (\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:phase_groove_constraint}) into
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:pci_kmin_engineering}) yields
\begin{equation}
  k_g \geq \frac{2}{w_0}.
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:pci_kmin_physics}
\end{equation}
As finite response requires that $|k| \geq k_g$, it follows that
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:pci_kmin_physics}) is equivalent to
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:kmin_for_far_field_beam_separation}),
which was derived by considering the far-field separation
of the scattered and unscattered beams.
Thus, PCI's low-$k$ cutoff
is ultimately constrained by the in-vessel beam size $w_0$,
with diffraction being the constraining physical mechanism.

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width = 0.75 \textwidth]{%
    Chapters/InterferometricMethods/figs/phase_plate_beam_separation.pdf}
  \caption[Transverse phase-plate dimensions]{%
    Transverse phase-plate dimensions.
    The unscattered beam is shown in red, while
    the scattered beams are shown in blue.}
  \label{fig:InterferometricMethods:phase_plate_beam_separation}
\end{figure}


\subsection{High-$k$ cutoff of phase plate}
Let the phase plate have a diameter $D$, as is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:InterferometricMethods:phase_plate_beam_separation}.
Detection of the scattered radiation
requires that (most of) the scattered beam reflect
from the face of the phase plate
(e.g.\ $\Delta \leq D / 2$).
Application of the phase-plate beam-separation formula
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:phase_plate_beam_separation})
then shows that there will be finite PCI response for $|k| \leq k_D$ where
\begin{equation}
  k_D \equiv \frac{k_0 D}{2 f}.
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:pci_kmax_engineering}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Effect of phase plate on $m$\ts{th} scattered beam}
The effect of the PCI phase plate on the $m$\ts{th} scattered beam
is given by the complex-valued function $\mathcal{E}(\vect{r}_m, k)$,
which is derived and thoroughly discussed in
Appendix~\ref{app:PCIResponseIdentities}.
The relevant results are briefly summarized here for completeness.
Eq.~(\ref{eq:PCIResponseIdentities:transformation_Hermitian_decomposed})
shows that PCI's image-plane $\mathcal{E}(\vect{r}_m, k)$
readily reduces to
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{E}(\vect{r}_{m,\image}, k_{\image})
    &=
    e^{-[x_{m,\image} / w(z_{m,\image})]^2}
    e^{i m k_{\image} x_{\image}}
    \\
    &\quad\times
    \left[%
      F(\vect{r}_{m,\image}, k_{\image})
      +
      G(\vect{r}_{m,\image}, k_{\image})
    \right],
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:PCI_transformation_Hermitian_decomposed}
\end{equation}
where the phase-plate face acts on the $m$\ts{th} scattered beam via $F$, and
the phase-plate groove acts on the $m$\ts{th} scattered beam via $G$.
$F$ and $G$ are themselves defined in
(\ref{eq:PCIResponseIdentities:transformation_face}) and
(\ref{eq:PCIResponseIdentities:transformation_groove}).
Of particular note, $F$ is Hermitian with respect to $m$
\begin{equation}
  F(\vect{r}_{-m,\image}, k_{\image})
  =
  F^*(\vect{r}_{m,\image}, k_{\image}),
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:mth_beam_interaction_with_face_hermitian}
\end{equation}
while $G$ is anti-Hermitian with respect to $m$
\begin{equation}
  G(\vect{r}_{-m,\image}, k_{\image})
  =
  -G^*(\vect{r}_{m,\image}, k_{\image}).
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:mth_beam_interaction_with_groove_antihermitian}
\end{equation}
These symmetries imply
that $F(\vect{r}_{0,\image}, k_{\image})$ is purely \emph{real} and
that $G(\vect{r}_{0,\image}, k_{\image})$ is purely \emph{imaginary}.


\subsection{The imaged field and its intensity}
\label{sec:InterferometricMethods:pci:imaged_field_and_intensity}
Introducing the notational shorthand
$F_m \equiv F(\vect{r}_{m,\image}, k_{\image})$ and
$G_m \equiv G(\vect{r}_{m,\image}, k_{\image})$,
the weak-coupling ($\tilde{\phi}_0 \ll 1$), image-plane electric field from
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:imaged_total_field_weak_coupling_Fourier_filtered})
readily reduces to
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  E(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  \approx
  E_G(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  e^{i \bar{\phi}}
  \biggl\{%
    F_{0} + G_{0}
    &+
    i \frac{\tilde{\phi}_0}{2}
    \biggl[
      (F_{1} + G_{1}) e^{i \nu}
      \\
      &+
      (F_{-1} + G_{-1}) e^{-i \nu}
    \biggr]
  \biggr\},
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the approximation $w(z_m) \approx w(z)$ has been used,
$\nu$ is defined in (\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:image_plane_nu}), and
$E_G(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)$ would be the image-plane electric field
of the unscattered beam in the \emph{absence} of the phase plate.
Now, recall that $F$ is Hermitian such that
$F_{-1} = F^{*}_{1}$ and $F_{0} = \real(F_{0})$ and
that $G$ is anti-Hermitian such that
$G_{-1} = -G^{*}_{1}$ and $G_{0} = {i \cdot \imag(G_{0})}$;
using these substitutions, the field further reduces to
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    E(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
    =
    E_G(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
    e^{i \bar{\phi}}
    \biggl\{%
      &\real(F_0) - \tilde{\phi}_0 \imag(G_1 e^{i \nu})
      \\
      &+
      i \left[ \imag(G_0) + \tilde{\phi}_0 \real(F_1 e^{i \nu}) \right]
    \biggr\},
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
and the corresponding intensity,
averaged over an optical cycle and
to first order in $\tilde{\phi}_0$, is
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    I_{\text{pci}}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
    &=
    I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})
    \biggl\{%
      |F_0|^2 + |G_0|^2
      \\
      &
      +
      2 \tilde{\phi}_0
      \bigl[%
        \imag(G_0) \real(F_1 e^{i \nu})
        -
        \real(F_0) \imag(G_1 e^{i \nu})
      \bigr]
    \biggr\},
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})$
would be the intensity profile (averaged over an optical cycle)
of the unscattered beam in the \emph{absence} of the phase plate.
Using the fact that $e^{i \nu} = \cos\nu + {i \sin\nu}$,
$F_1 = \real(F_1) + {i \cdot \imag(F_1)}$, and
$G_1 = \real(G_1) + {i \cdot \imag(G_1)}$,
the image-plane intensity further reduces to
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    I_{\text{pci}}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
    &=
    I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})
    \biggl\{%
      |F_0|^2 + |G_0|^2
      \\
      &+
      2 \tilde{\phi}_0
      \left[ \imag(G_0)\real(F_1) - \real(F_0)\imag(G_1) \right] \cos\nu
      \\
      &-
      2 \tilde{\phi}_0
      \left[ \imag(G_0)\imag(F_1) + \real(F_0)\real(G_1) \right] \sin\nu
    \biggr\}.
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:PCI_image_plane_intensity_linear_combination_of_sine_and_cosine}
\end{equation}

Note that the linear combination
$A_I \cos \nu - A_Q \sin \nu$ for real $A_I$, $A_Q$, and $\nu$
can be rewritten as
\begin{align}
  A_I \cos \nu - A_Q \sin \nu
  &=
  A \cos(\nu + \theta),
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:linear_combination_of_sine_and_cosine}
\end{align}
where
$A = (A_I^2 + A_Q^2)^{1/2}$,
$\theta = \atantwo(A_Q, A_I)$,
and $\atantwo(A_Q, A_I)$ is the arctangent function of two arguments, which
uses the signs of $A_Q$ and $A_I$ to correctly determine the quadrant
corresponding to a tangent of $A_Q / A_I$.
Note that the notation is mnemonic:
$A_I$ is the amplitude of the ``in-phase'' ($I$) component
(i.e.\ proportional to the image of the assumed
cosine phase fluctuation $\tilde{\phi}(x, t)$ from
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:cosine_phase_fluctuation})), and
$A_Q$ is the amplitude of the corresponding ``quadrature'' ($Q$) component.

As was the case for external reference-beam interferometry,
it is useful to characterize PCI's performance
relative to the saturation limits of a given detector.
Because $\tilde{\phi}_0 \ll 1$,
the PCI optical intensity
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:PCI_image_plane_intensity_linear_combination_of_sine_and_cosine})
satisfies
\begin{align}
  I_{\text{pci}}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)
  &\lesssim
  I_G(0)
  \left( |F_0|^2 + |G_0|^2 \right),
  \notag
\end{align}
where $I_G(0) = I_G(\rho_{\image} = 0, z_{\image})$ is convenient shorthand
for the peak intensity of the unscattered Gaussian probe beam at the detector
in the \emph{absence} of the phase plate.
To obtain optimal performance, select $I_G(0)$ such that
\begin{equation}
  I_{\text{sat}}
  =
  I_G(0)
  \left( |F_0|^2 + |G_0|^2 \right),
  \notag
\end{equation}
where $I_{\text{sat}}$ is the detector's linear saturation intensity.
Then, taking inspiration from
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:linear_combination_of_sine_and_cosine}),
the image-plane PCI intensity fluctuations from
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:PCI_image_plane_intensity_linear_combination_of_sine_and_cosine})
can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\tilde{I}_{\text{pci}}(\vect{r}_{\image}, t)}{I_{\text{sat}}}
  =
  \frac{I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})}{I_G(0)}
  \cdot
  A_{\text{pci}}(k_{\image}, x_{\image})
  \cdot
  \tilde{\phi}_0
  \cos\left[ \nu + \theta_{\text{pci}}(k_{\image}, x_{\image}) \right],
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
  A_{\text{pci}}(k_{\image}, x_{\image})
  &\equiv
  \frac{2 A(k_{\image}, x_{\image})}{|F_0|^2 + |G_0|^2},
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:PCI_amplitude_response}
  \\
  \theta_{\text{pci}}(k_{\image}, x_{\image})
  &\equiv
  \atantwo(A_Q, A_I),
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
  A(k_{\image}, x_{\image})
  &\equiv
  (A_I^2 + A_Q^2)^{1/2},
  \\
  A_I(k_{\image}, x_{\image})
  &\equiv
  \imag(G_0)\real(F_1) - \real(F_0)\imag(G_1),
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:PCI_response_AI}
  \\
  A_Q(k_{\image}, x_{\image})
  &\equiv
  \imag(G_0)\imag(F_1) + \real(F_0)\real(G_1).
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:PCI_response_AQ}
\end{align}

Thus, the action of the phase plate results in both
an amplitude response $A_{\text{pci}}(k_{\image}, x_{\image})$ and
a phase response $\theta_{\text{pci}}(k_{\image}, x_{\image})$
in PCI's image-plane intensity.
The on-axis responses $A_{\text{pci}}(k_{\image}, x_{\image} = 0)$ and
$\theta_{\text{pci}}(k_{\image}, x_{\image} = 0) = 0$
are consistent with previous derivations at $x_{\image} = 0$,
such as \cite[Eq.~2.141]{coda_phd} and \cite[Eq.~20]{rost_low_k_pci}.
The present work, however, explicitly accounts for
the spatial variation in the amplitude and phase responses
across the face of the detector.
Note that PCI operates as a nonlinear system
if there are substantial spatial variations in either
$A_{\text{pci}}$ or $\theta_{\text{pci}}$.
The amplitude and phase responses
can be easily evaluated numerically, and
the results for typical system parameters are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:InterferometricMethods:phase_plate_amplitude_and_phase_response}.
As is colloquially understood, the amplitude response $A_{\text{pci}}$
drops precipitously for $|k| \lesssim k_g$.
(Additionally, the spatial variation in the amplitude response is minimal).
However, perhaps less well known, is the fact that
the phase response $\theta_{\text{pci}}$ exhibits
dramatic spatial variation for $|k| \lesssim k_g$.
This spatial variation biases the PCI-measured wavenumber $k_{\text{meas}}$
away from the true wavenumber $k$,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:InterferometricMethods:pci_wavenumber_upshift}.
The physical explanation for this effect is relatively simple:
a Gaussian beam can be decomposed into a set of infinite plane waves
with a finite spread in transverse wavevectors
(see Section~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:Gaussian_beam_diffraction:Gaussian_beam_definition}),
and only the components of the scattered beam
with transverse lab-frame wavenumbers $|k| \geq k_g$
are reflected from the phase-plate face and
produce measurable interference on the PCI detector.

    \caption[Nonlinear upshift in low-$k$, PCI-measured wavenumber]{%
    PCI-measured wavenumber $k_{\text{meas}}$ vs.\ true wavenumber $k$.
    Wavenumbers are normalized

    The system magnification is $M = 0.5$, a fairly typical value.
    The dashed vertical lines indicate

    (\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:pci_kmin_physics}).
    For $|k| \gtrsim k_g$,
    $k_{\text{meas}}$ has a $1:1$ linear relationship with $k$;
    however, for $|k| \lesssim k_g$,
    $k_{\text{meas}}$ is \emph{not} linearly related to $k$.
    Thus, a transfer-function description of the PCI operation
    is only appropriate for wavenumbers above the low-$k$ cutoff
    ($|k| \gtrsim k_g$).
  }
\label{fig:InterferometricMethods:pci_wavenumber_upshift}
\end{figure}

Thus, for $|k| \lesssim k_g$, PCI operates as a nonlinear system
that cannot be described via a transfer function.
Practically speaking, PCI's nonlinear low-$k$ operation
prevents it from measuring the wavenumbers of low-$k$ fluctuations,
such as MHD and some ion-scale instabilities.
(Of course, because the PCI amplitude response $A_{\text{pci}}$
drops precipitously for $|k| \lesssim k_g$,
such low-$k$ fluctuations may be altogether invisible to PCI anyways).
For $|k| \gtrsim k_g$, however, a transfer function can be defined.
Specifically, for $|k| \gtrsim k_g$,
the phase-plate face reflects the scattered beam
($F_1 \rightarrow 1$), while
the phase-plate groove minimally affects the scattered beam
($G_1 \rightarrow 0$).
Further, assuming the majority of the unscattered beam
falls within the phase groove
(i.e.\ constraint (\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:phase_groove_constraint})),
the phase-plate groove attenuates and phase shifts the unscattered beam
($G_0 \rightarrow i \sqrt{\eta}$), while
the phase-plate face minimally affects the unscattered beam
($F_0 \rightarrow 0$).
Thus, $\theta_{\text{pci}} \rightarrow 0$ and
$A_{\text{pci}} \rightarrow 2 / \sqrt{\eta}$ such that
the PCI transfer function can be defined as
\begin{equation}
  T_{\text{pci}}(k)
  =
  \begin{cases}
    \dfrac{2}{\sqrt{\eta}}, & |k| \gtrsim k_g \\
    \text{undefined},      & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}.
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:PCI_wavenumber_transfer_function}
\end{equation}
As presented here, for $|k| \gtrsim k_g$,
$T_{\text{pci}}$ is independent of the fluctuation wavenumber;
however, the finite sampling-volume effects
that accompany any real-world measurement
introduce a wavenumber dependence,
as discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:DesignConsiderations:geometric:finite_sampling_volume}.

As is the case with the homodyne interferometer,
the PCI technique does \emph{not} make an absolute measurement
of the phase-fluctuation amplitude $\tilde{\phi}_0$.
To see this, note that the PCI amplitude response $A_{\text{pci}}$
depends very sensitively on the system alignment,
with slight excursions of the unscattered beam
from the partially reflective phase-plate groove
onto the fully reflective phase-plate face
resulting in macroscopic changes to the power reaching the detector.
Further, power fluctuations at the beam source
can alter $I_G(\vect{r}_{\image})$.
Thus, there are three potentially dynamic quantities:
$\{\tilde{\phi}_0, I_G(\vect{r}_{\image}), A_{\text{pci}}\}$,
but there are only two potentially measurable quantities:
the equilibrium and fluctuating powers.
PCI systems on large, vibration-prone fusion devices
typically employ feedback stabilization
(see e.g.~\cite[Ch.~3.5]{coda_phd})
in order to dynamically maintain
the unscattered beam's alignment
on the phase-plate groove,
minimizing vibrational contamination of the PCI signal.
It is then possible, after measuring a calibration constant,
to \emph{estimate} the phase-fluctuation amplitude $\tilde{\phi}_0$ with PCI.


\section{Selecting an interferometric technique}
\label{sec:InterferometricMethods:selection}
Sections~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:interferometry}
and~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:pci}
detail external reference-beam interferometry and
phase contrast imaging (PCI), respectively.
The intent of this section is to synthesize these results and
to discuss the strengths and limitations
of these interferometric techniques
so that a suitable method can be selected for a given application.


\subsection{Sensitivity}
\label{sec:InterferometricMethods:selection:sensitivity}
The transfer functions in
Sections~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:interferometry}
and~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:pci}
specify the fraction of a given detector's dynamic range
that is occupied by the fluctuating signal.
If identical detectors are used for each interferometric method,
then an ``apples-to-apples'' comparison of fluctuation sensitivities
can be made by examining the amplitudes
of the corresponding transfer functions.
(See Section~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:selection:temporal_bandwidth}
for practical considerations regarding detector selection).
Just such a comparison is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:InterferometricMethods:interferometric_method_transfer_functions}.
Clearly, for a given fluctuation ($|k| \gtrsim k_g$) and a given detector,
PCI has the best sensitivity.
Specifically, PCI is
$T_{\text{pci}} / T_{\text{hom}} = 2 / \sqrt{\eta}$
more sensitive than a comparable homodyne interferometer
($\phi_R - \bar{\phi} = \pi / 2$) and
$T_{\text{pci}} / T_{\text{het}} = 2 \pi \sqrt{2 / \eta}$
more sensitive than a comparable heterodyne interferometer.
Relative to homodyne interferometry,
PCI's enhanced sensitivity is wholly attributable
to the partial reflectivity ($\eta < 1$) of the phase-plate groove:
the decreased power in the unscattered beam
increases the fraction of the detector's dynamic range
occupied by the fluctuating signal.
The sensitivity deficit of heterodyne interferometry
relative to homodyne interferometry
has two physical origins:
first, the heterodyne interferometer
must capture the full sinusoidal waveform
of the heterodyne interference signal,
which mandates reduction of the mean optical intensity
(and, correspondingly, the fluctuating optical intensity)
at the detector by a factor of two
relative to that of the homodyne interferometer;
second, demodulation of the heterodyne interference signal
additionally attenuates the fluctuating signal.

  \caption[Comparison of interferometric-method transfer functions]{%
    A comparison of the transfer functions for
    PCI
    (\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:PCI_wavenumber_transfer_function}),
    heterodyne interferometry
    (\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:heterodyne_interferometer_wavenumber_transfer_function}),
    and homodyne interferometry
    (\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:homodyne_interferometer_wavenumber_transfer_function},
    in the optimal fluctuation configuration
    with $\phi_R - \bar{\phi} = \pi / 2$).
    Object-plane wavenumbers $k$ are normalized
    to the 1/e $E$ radius of the in-vessel probe beam, $w_0$.
    The magnification of each system is taken to be $|M| = 0.5$,
    which is a representative ``typical'' value.
    The vertical, dashed lines indicate
    the low-$k$ cutoff of the PCI phase-plate groove, $k_g$;
    here, $k_g = 2 / w_0$,
    which is the minimum value allowed by diffraction,
    as discussed in
    (\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:pci_kmin_physics}).
    The phase-plate high-$k$ cutoff, $k_D$,
    is taken to be infinite.
    The reflectivity of the PCI phase groove is $\eta = 0.17$,
    which is characteristic of the ZnSe typically
    employed in $\SI{10.6}{\micro\meter}$ optics.
    Because the PCI transfer function is not defined for $|k| \lesssim k_g$,
    the low-$k$ PCI amplitude response
    (\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:PCI_amplitude_response})
    is indicated by the dash-dot curves instead.
  }
\label{fig:InterferometricMethods:interferometric_method_transfer_functions}
\end{figure}

The enhanced sensitivity of PCI and homodyne interferometry
relative to that of heterodyne interferometry
comes with several costs, however.
First, as previously discussed,
neither PCI nor homodyne interferometry
measure the absolute scale of phase fluctuations, while
heterodyne interferometry does.
Second, PCI depends sensitively on the position
of the unscattered beam relative to the phase-plate groove, and
homodyne interferometry depends sensitively on $\phi_R - \bar{\phi}$;
often, feedback stabilization is required
to dynamically maintain the optimal configuration
\cite[Ch.~3.5]{coda_phd}\cite{nazikian_rsi87}.
While feedback stabilization is an added technical complication,
it should be noted that such feedback
is expected to become more commonplace
for laser diagnostics on large fusion devices,
such as ITER's heterodyne interferometer
\cite{vanzeeland_TIP_rsi13}.
Finally, PCI cannot measure the equilibrium phase $\bar{\phi}$.
This makes intuitive sense:
$\bar{\phi}$ uniformly affects both the scattered and unscattered beams,
the PCI phase delays the unscattered beam
to generate an ``internal'' reference beam, and
the $\bar{\phi}$ information cancels in the resulting interference.
A homodyne interferometer operated with $\phi_R - \bar{\phi} = \pi / 2$
is similarly unable to measure $\bar{\phi}$.
In contrast, a heterodyne interferometer
can always measure both the equilibrium phase $\bar{\phi}$ and
the fluctuating phase $\tilde{\phi}$.


\subsection{Spatial bandwidth}
PCI's sensitivity comes at the additional expense of spatial bandwidth.
Specifically, the creation of an ``internal'' reference beam
via spatial filtering
produces a low-$k$ cutoff in the PCI response, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:InterferometricMethods:interferometric_method_transfer_functions}.
The minimum size of this cutoff is
set by diffraction of the in-vessel probe beam
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:pci_kmin_physics}), but
it is not uncommon for the realized cutoff
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:pci_kmin_engineering})
to be $\sim 2-3\times$ larger than the diffraction limit.
As shown in Figures~\ref{fig:InterferometricMethods:phase_plate_amplitude_and_phase_response}
and \ref{fig:InterferometricMethods:pci_wavenumber_upshift},
PCI operates as a nonlinear system below its low-$k$ cutoff,
preventing a transfer-function description of its low-$k$ behavior.
In contrast, by using an external reference beam,
homodyne and heterodyne interferometers
operate as linear systems over the entire wavenumber spectrum and
are even capable of making measurements at $k = 0$.

Now, colloquially, interferometry is considered a ``low-$k$'' technique, and
PCI is considered a ``high-$k$'' technique.
However, as detailed in
Section~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:Gaussian_beam_diffraction:from_plasma_density_fluctuations},
for a given probe beam and a given fluctuation $\tilde{\phi}$,
the laser-plasma interaction is \emph{identical}
for both interferometry and PCI.
Further, the high-$k$ optical capabilities of interferometry and PCI
are governed by the size of the collection optics
and finite sampling-volume effects~\cite{bravenec_rsi95}.
Thus, there is nothing that intrinsically limits
interferometry to low-$k$ measurements ---
an interferometer's high-$k$ limit
can be just as high, if not higher,
than that of a given PCI system.
However, as discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:InterferometricMethods:selection:sensitivity},
PCI is \emph{more sensitive} to fluctuations
than a comparable interferometer, and,
assuming a Kolmogorov-like fluctuation spectrum
$S(k) \propto k^{-p}$ for some positive $p$,
PCI's superior sensitivity may allow it
to detect high-$k$ fluctuations
that are too weak to be seen by an interferometer.


\subsection{Temporal bandwidth}
\label{sec:InterferometricMethods:selection:temporal_bandwidth}
Detector bandwidth is often the dominant constraint
of an interferometric system's temporal bandwidth.
Homodyne interferometry and PCI require
\begin{equation}
  \omega_{\text{det}} > \omega,
  \qquad \qquad \quad% \qquad
  \text{homodyne interferometry, PCI,}
\end{equation}
where
$\omega_{\text{det}}$ is the angular cutoff frequency of the detector and
$\omega$ is the angular frequency of the fluctuation.
Heterodyne interferometry, however, requires
\begin{equation}
  \omega_{\text{det}} > \Delta \omega_0 + \omega,
  \qquad
  \text{heterodyne interferometry,}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta \omega_0$ is the (angular) intermediate frequency.
Further, proper reconstruction of the baseband signal
from the heterodyne interference signal requires $\omega < \Delta \omega_0$.

Thus, for a given fluctuation $\omega \ll \Delta \omega_0$,
heterodyne interferometry requires a much faster detector
than homodyne interferometry or PCI\@.
For the HgCdTe detectors typically used at $\SI{10.6}{\micro\meter}$,
cooling the active element of the detector
reduces detector noise and increases the detector response
at the expense of reduced $\omega_{\text{det}}$.
Thus, for low--bandwidth applications ($\omega \ll \Delta \omega_0$),
homodyne interferometry and PCI may be able to use
slower, cooled detectors that are less noisy than
the comparable faster, warmer detectors
required for heterodyne interferometry.
The use of less noisy detectors
may produce sensitivity gains for PCI and homodyne interferometry
relative to heterodyne interferometry.
Although use of a ``slow'' detector prevents measurements
of broadband fluctuations beyond the detector cutoff,
it \emph{is} possible to measure coherent, high-frequency fluctuations
well beyond the detector cutoff ($\omega \gg \omega_{\text{det}}$)
by rapidly modulating the intensity of the probe beam
\cite[Sec.~3.3.1]{tsujii_phd}.
