\section{Gaussian beam diffraction}


\subsection{Definition of a Gaussian beam}
A Gaussian beam of angular frequency $\omega_0$
propagating along the $z$-axis
has an electric field
\begin{equation}
  E(\vect{r}, t)
  =
  E_G(\vect{r}) e^{-i \omega_0 t}
\end{equation}
with spatial dependence~\cite{siegman_lasers}
\begin{equation}
  E_G(\vect{r})
  =
  E_0
  \frac{w_0}{w(z)}
  \exp\left[ \frac{-\rho^2}{w(z)^2} \right]
  \exp\left\{ i \left[
    k_0 z
    +
    \frac{k_0 \rho^2}{2 R(z)}
    -
    \psi(z) \right] \right\}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Gaussian_beam}
\end{equation}
Here,
$\rho = (x^2 + y^2)^{1/2}$ is the transverse distance from the optical axis,
$w_0$ is the radius of the beam's waist, and
$k_0 = \omega_0 / c = 2 \pi / \lambda_0$ is the beam's wavenumber.
The beam's width $w(z)$, radius of curvature $R(z)$, and
Gouy phase $\psi(z)$ are defined as
\begin{align}
  w(z)
  &=
  w_0 \left[ 1 + \left( \frac{z}{z_R} \right)^2 \right]^{1/2}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Gaussian_beam_width}
  \\
  R(z)
  &=
  z \left[ 1 + \left( \frac{z_R}{z} \right)^2 \right]
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Gaussian_beam_radius_of_curvature}
  \\
  \psi(z)
  &=
  \atan\left( \frac{z}{z_R} \right)
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Gouy_phase}
\end{align}
where the Rayleigh range
\begin{equation}
  z_R \equiv \frac{\pi w_0^2}{\lambda_0}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Rayleigh_range}
\end{equation}
is the nominal division between the beam's
near-field ($|z| \ll z_R$) and far-field ($|z| \gg z_R$) behaviors.


\subsection{Kirchhoff diffraction theory}
A monochromatic scalar wave $U(\vect{r}) e^{-i \omega t}$ in vacuum
satisfies the Helmholtz equation
\begin{equation}
  (\nabla^2 + k^2) U = 0
\end{equation}
where $k = \omega / c$.
The Helmholtz-Kirchhoff integral theorem states
that the field at a point $P$ is
\begin{equation}
  U(P)
  =
  \frac{1}{4 \pi}
  \int_S \left[
    U \frac{\partial}{\partial n}\left(\frac{e^{i k s}}{s}\right)
    -
    \frac{e^{i k s}}{s} \frac{\partial U}{\partial n}
  \right] dS
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Helmholtz_Kirchhoff_integral_theorem}
\end{equation}
where $S$ is an arbitrary surface that encloses $P$,
$\vect{s}$ is the vector from point $P$ to differential area element $dS$,
$\vect{n}$ is the \emph{inward}-pointing normal of surface $S$, and
$U$ is assumed to be differentiable to second order within and on $S$
\cite{born_and_wolf}.
The relevant geometry is sketched
in Fig.~\ref{fig:InterferometricMethods:Kirchhoff_geometry}(a).

\begin{figure}

  \caption{Geometries for Kirchhoff diffraction calculations.}
\label{fig:InterferometricMethods:Kirchhoff_geometry}
\end{figure}

To proceed with the diffraction calculation,
assume that the incident waves propagate in the $+z$-direction and
adopt the surface drawn
in Fig.~\ref{fig:InterferometricMethods:Kirchhoff_geometry}(b).
That is, $S = S_1 + S_2$,
where $S_1$ is a circle in the $(x, y)$-plane, and
$S_2$ is a spherical segment centered on the optical axis.
Now, assume that the incident waves were ``turned on''
at some finite time in the past, and
take the radius of $S_2$ to be large enough such that
none of the diffracted waves have had sufficient time to reach $S_2$,
i.e.\ $U \equiv 0$ on $S_2$.
(Of course, strictly speaking, the source's finite turn-on time
requires relaxation of the monochromatic assumption.
Finite turn-on time does not preclude a pseudo-monochromatic source, however,
and such a source is assumed hereafter).
Thus, the integral over $S_2$ vanishes, and
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:Helmholtz_Kirchhoff_integral_theorem})
reduces to an integral over $S_1$.

Evaluation of
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:Helmholtz_Kirchhoff_integral_theorem})
requires knowledge of $U$ on $S_1$.
For free-space propagation,
$S_1$ is an imagined (rather than a physical) surface
that does not impede the propagation of the incident beam $U^{(i)}$
(that is, $U = U^{(i)}$ and
$\partial U / \partial n = \partial U^{(i)} / \partial n$ on $S_1$).
If, however, $S_1$ contains opaque obstacles,
the free-space propagation conditions are no longer valid;
instead, the Kirchhoff boundary conditions can be adopted:
\begin{align}
  \text{surfaces of clear aperture:}&
  \quad
  U = U^{(i)},
  \quad
  \frac{\partial U}{\partial n} = \frac{\partial U^{(i)}}{\partial n}
  \\
  \text{opaque surfaces:}&
  \quad \;
  U = 0,
  \qquad
  \frac{\partial U}{\partial n} = 0
\end{align}
While these boundary conditions are adequate for the current application,
it should be noted that they are not physical
for points that are very close to the boundaries of the opaque obstacles.


\subsection{Fraunhofer diffraction of a free-space Gaussian beam}
Assume that the incident Gaussian beam has a waist at $S_1$, and
take the radius of $S_1$ to be much larger than the beam waist $w_0$
such that the domain of integration effectively extends
over the whole $(x, y)$-plane.
For free-space propagation,
$S_1$ does not perturb the Gaussian beam; thus,
$E(\vect{r}, t) = E^{(i)}(\vect{r}, t) = E_G(\vect{r}) e^{-i \omega_0 t}$.
Now, in the far-field ($k_0 s \gg 1$) and
paraxial ($\vect{s} \approx -z \hat{\vect{z}}$) approximations
\begin{align}
  \left. \frac{e^{i k_0 s}}{s} \right|_{S_1}
  &\approx
  \frac{e^{i k_0 s}}{z}
  \\
  \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial n}
  \left( \frac{e^{i k_0 s}}{s} \right) \right|_{S_1}
  &\approx
  -i k_0 \left( \frac{e^{i k_0 s}}{z} \right)
\end{align}
The $s$-dependence in the phase arguments has been retained,
as it is the mechanism responsible for diffraction, but
the $s$-dependence in the amplitude has been dropped
as it only gives rise to negligible variations
in the amplitude of the diffracted wave.
Relative to a spherical wave,
a Gaussian beam has several additional $z$-dependencies;
however, at the beam's waist
\begin{align}
  \left. \frac{\partial w(z)}{\partial z} \right|_{\text{waist}}
  &\equiv
  0
  \\
  \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial z}
  \left[ \frac{1}{R(z)} \right] \right|_{\text{waist}}
  &=
  \frac{1}{z_R^2}
  \\
  \left. \frac{\partial \psi(z)}{\partial z} \right|_{\text{waist}}
  &=
  \frac{1}{z_R}
\end{align}
Then, if the beam's Rayleigh range is much greater than
the probe wavelength ($k_0 z_R \gg 1$) and
the relevant transverse dimensions are much less than
the Rayleigh range ($w_0 \ll z_R$),
the Gaussian beam at $S_1$ satisfies
\begin{align}
  \left. E_G(\vect{r'}) \right|_{S_1}
  &\approx
  E_0 e^{-(\rho' / w_0)^2}
  \\
  \left. \frac{\partial E_G(\vect{r'})}{\partial n} \right|_{S_1}
  &\approx
  i k_0 \left[ E_0 e^{-(\rho' / w_0)^2} \right]
\end{align}
Note that the CO$_2$ laser beams ($k_0 \approx \SI{2 \pi e5}{\per\meter}$)
that probe tokamak plasmas often have $z_R \gg \SI{10}{\meter}$
such that $k_0 z_R \gg 1$ and $w_0 \ll z_R$
(the transverse dimensions are constrained by the machine size
such that $w_0 \ll \SI{1}{\meter}$) are very well satisfied.

Substituting the above expressions for
the incident waves and their surface-normal derivatives into
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:Helmholtz_Kirchhoff_integral_theorem})
and simplifying yields
\begin{equation}
  E(\vect{r})
  \approx
  \frac{-i E_0}{\lambda_0 z}
  \int_{S_1}
  e^{-( \rho' / w_0 )^2}
  e^{i k_0 s}
  dS
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Kirchhoff_diffraction_integral}
\end{equation}
To proceed further, $s$ must be approximated:
\begin{align}
  s
  &=
  | \vect{r'} - \vect{r}|
  \notag \\
  &=
  \left[ r^2 - 2(x'x + y'y) + (x'^2 + y'^2) \right]^{1/2}
  \notag \\
  &\approx
  r - \frac{x'x + y'y}{r}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Fraunhofer_s}
\end{align}
where only terms linear in $(x' / r)$ and $(y' / r)$ have been retained.
This is known as the Fraunhofer limit, and
it is valid for $z \gg z_R$~\cite{born_and_wolf}.
Under the Fraunhofer limit
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:Kirchhoff_diffraction_integral}) becomes
\begin{equation}
  E(\vect{r})
  \approx
  \frac{-i E_0}{\lambda_0 z}
  e^{i k_0 r}
  D_x D_y
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Fraunhofer_diffracted_field}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  D_x
  =
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
  e^{-( x' / w_0 )^2}
  e^{-i k_0 x x' / r}
  dx'
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Fraunhofer_diffraction_integral_free_space}
\end{equation}
gives the diffraction pattern in the $x$-direction, and
replacing $x$ with $y$ in
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:Fraunhofer_diffraction_integral_free_space})
yields the expression for the diffraction pattern in the $y$-direction, $D_y$.
Note that the $e^{-i k_0 x x' / r} = e^{-i k_0 x' \sin\theta}$ term
is the typical geometric phase factor
of interference and diffraction calculations
that results from path-length differences between
points on surface $S_1$ and the field point $\vect{r}$, as shown in
Fig.~{\ref{fig:InterferometricMethods:Fraunhofer_geometric_phase_factor}}.
Eq.~(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:Fraunhofer_diffraction_integral_free_space})
is easily evaluated, as it is simply the Fourier transform of a Gaussian
\begin{equation}
  D_x
  =
  \sqrt{\pi} w_0 e^{-(k_0 w_0 x / 2 r)^2}
\end{equation}
and (\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:Fraunhofer_diffracted_field}) becomes
\begin{equation}
  E(\vect{r})
  \approx
  -i E_0
  \left( \frac{z_R}{z} \right)
  e^{-(k_0 w_0 \rho / 2 r)^2}
  e^{i k_0 r}
  \label{eq:InterferometricMethods:Fraunhofer_Gaussian_beam_diffraction}
\end{equation}
Is this consistent
with the expected far-field representation of a Gaussian beam? Yes!
To see this, note that in the far-field ($z \gg z_R$)
\begin{align}
  &\frac{z_R}{z}
  \approx
  \frac{w_0}{w(z)}
  \\
  &\frac{k_0 w_0 \rho}{2 r}
  \approx
  \frac{\rho}{w(z)}
  \\
  &r
  \approx
  z + \frac{\rho^2}{2 R(z)}
  \\
  &-i
  = e^{-i \pi / 2}
  \approx
  e^{-i \psi(z)}
\end{align}
such that
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:Fraunhofer_Gaussian_beam_diffraction})
can be cast in the form of a typical Gaussian beam
as expressed in
(\ref{eq:InterferometricMethods:Gaussian_beam}),
i.e.\ $E(\vect{r}) \approx E_G(\vect{r})$.
